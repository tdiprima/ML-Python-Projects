## What does 1e-4 mean?

1e-4 is a scientific notation that represents a decimal number in a more compact form. Specifically, 1e-4 means 1 multiplied by 10 to the power of -4, which is equivalent to 0.0001. The "e" in 1e-4 stands for "exponent," and the number after it (-4 in this case) represents the power to which 10 is raised. So, 1e-4 is a shorthand way of writing 0.0001, which is one ten-thousandth of 1.

## remove_background

Let's say we have a 210 x 160 RGB display.  And my dude decides to set

```py
image[image == 144] = 0
image[image == 109] = 0
```

Assuming that image is a NumPy array representing an RGB image with dimensions 210 x 160, it's setting the <span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">red channel</span> of all pixels with a value of 144 and the <span style="color: green;font-weight:bold;">green channel</span> of all pixels with a value of 109 to 0.

In other words, the code is replacing specific colors in the image with black (0, 0, 0) by setting the red and green components of those pixels to 0. The blue component of each pixel is not affected by this operation.

It's worth noting that the specific color values 144 and 109 may correspond to different colors depending on the color space used by the image. Without more context, it's difficult to say exactly which colors are being replaced.

## Red and Green

<span style="color:#0000dd;">How did you know that the code is affecting the red and green channels (versus, say, blue and green)?  Like, how does "image[image == 144]" mean the red channel? Because it's the first one?</span>

The order of the color channels in the image array depends on the specific format of the image. In most cases, the color channels are stored in the order Red-Green-Blue (RGB), which is the case for the image format assumed in the original question.

When we use the code `image[image == 144]`, we are using **Boolean indexing** to select all pixels in the image whose red channel has a value of 144.

### Fireball

Oh! ðŸ™ˆ  I think I got it.  I think it doesn't matter.  Any pixel with 144 in it, that channel gets a 0.  109? Zero.  Because we're removing the background, and the background is brown orange.

`#a63e00` is rgba(166, 62, 0, 1) is "Fire".

rgba(144, 109, 0, 1) is `#906d00` is "Corn Harvest".


### ok then

Boolean indexing.  The resulting selection is a NumPy array with the same dimensions as the original image, but only contains True values where the red channel is 144, and False values elsewhere.

By applying the assignment `= 0` to this selection, we are setting the red channel of those pixels to 0, effectively removing the red component of those pixels.

Similarly, the code `image[image == 109]` is selecting all pixels in the image whose green channel has a value of 109, and the subsequent assignment `= 0` is setting the green channel of those pixels to 0.

So, the reason we know that the code is affecting the red and green channels, rather than blue and green, is that we are selecting pixels based on their red and green channel values, respectively. If we wanted to select pixels based on their blue channel values, we would use <span style="color:#0000dd;">image[image == x, 2]</span>, where `x` is the desired blue channel value.
