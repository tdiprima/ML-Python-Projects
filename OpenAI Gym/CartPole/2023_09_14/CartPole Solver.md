# Solve CartPole

To solve the CartPole-v1 game in Python, you will need to use the OpenAI Gym library to create and interact with the environment. Here is an example code snippet that uses the library to solve the game:

<a href="cartpole-solver-example.py">cartpole-solver-example.py</a>

1. Create the CartPole environment using `gym.make()`.

1. Reset the environment using `env.reset()`.
    * Get the initial state and an empty dictionary.

1. Run a loop until the game is completed.

1. In each iteration of the loop, choose an action based on the current state.
    * *(which is not shown in the code, as it depends on the specific algorithm used to solve the game)*

1. Take the chosen action using `env.step()`, which returns the next state, the reward for the action, a flag indicating whether the game is completed, and another empty dictionary.

1. Finally, close the environment using `env.close()`.


`choose_action()` is a placeholder function that represents the algorithm you would use to choose actions based on the current state in your implementation of the `CartPole-v1` game.

In reinforcement learning, there are many different algorithms that can be used to choose actions, such as Q-learning, SARSA, policy gradient methods, etc.

Here is an example implementation of `choose_action()` using a simple heuristic that takes the angle and velocity of the pole into account:

```py
def choose_action(state):
    angle, _, pole_velocity, _ = state
    if angle < 0:
        return 0 # move left
    else:
        return 1 # move right
```

If the angle of the pole is negative, the function chooses to move the cart left.

Otherwise, it chooses to move the cart right.

This is a simple heuristic that is <mark>**unlikely to solve the game**<mark>, but it gives you an idea of how the `choose_action()` function could be implemented.

## Q-learning algorithm

Here is an example implementation of a Q-learning algorithm to solve the CartPole-v1 game using the OpenAI Gym library in Python:

<a href="discretization.py">discretization.py</a>

1. Define the hyperparameters for the Q-learning algorithm, such as the learning rate alpha, the discount factor gamma, the exploration rate epsilon, the number of episodes `num_episodes`, and the maximum number of steps per episode `max_steps`.

1. Create the CartPole environment using `gym.make()`, and initialize the Q-table with zeros.
    * The Q-table is a multidimensional array that stores the expected rewards for each state-action pair in the game.

1. Loop over the episodes, and for each episode, reset the environment and loop over the steps.

1. In each step, choose an action using an epsilon-greedy policy, then take the chosen action using `env.step()`, and update the Q-value using the Q-learning formula:

    ```ruby
    Q[state][action] += alpha * (reward + gamma * np.max(Q[next_state]) - Q[state][action])
    ```

1. After each episode, decay the exploration rate epsilon to gradually reduce the amount of exploration as the algorithm learns.

1. Finally, close the environment and print the final Q-table. 

Note that this code does not include any code for testing the Q-table or visualizing the game, but it should provide a good starting point for building a Q-learning algorithm to solve the CartPole-v1 game.

## CartPole Q-Learning with Discretization

The CartPole environment in OpenAI Gym has a continuous state space, so you can't directly index into a Q-table like you're trying to do with `Q[state]`. This approach is more suited for environments with discrete state spaces. There are a few ways to handle this issue:

1. **Discretization:** You can discretize the state space so that it's easier to work with. This means mapping continuous state values to a smaller set of discrete values.

2. **Function Approximation:** You can use a function approximator like a neural network to learn the Q-values. This is a more complex but also a more flexible method.

Here's a simpler example using discretization for the CartPole problem:

<a href="discretization.py">discretization.py</a>

In this example, I defined a function `discretize()` to map each continuous state to a discrete index that can be used to look up the Q-value in a table. The `num_bins` variable determines how many bins there are for each state dimension. Adjust the numbers to find a trade-off between resolution and computational cost.

## Next

I apologize for the oversight. The error occurs because `env.reset()` returns a NumPy array representing the initial state of the environment, but it seems like my `discretize` function is incorrectly treating it as a dictionary, which leads to the error message you received. Also, I mistakenly added extra output variables (`truncated` and `info`) to the `env.step(action)` method, which should not be there.

Let's correct these issues. The modified code below should work correctly:

<a href="discretization.py">discretization.py</a>

In this revised version, I changed the `discretize` function to use `np.digitize` correctly. I also set specific bin edges for each state dimension, which are defined in the `num_bins` list. Lastly, I corrected the `env.step()` method to return only four values, which are unpacked correctly.

Try running this corrected version and let me know how it goes.

## Finally

Thanks!  I only had to change 2 things to make it work:

1. Line 33: has to be `env.reset()[0]` because env.reset() returns 2 things.
2. Line 42: has to be `next_state, reward, done, foo, bar = env.step(action)` because env.step(action) returns 5 things.

You're correct, and I apologize for the oversight.

Thank you for catching those errors and fixing them. In summary:

1. If `env.reset()` is returning two things, it's appropriate to unpack them accordingly. Using `env.reset()[0]` will give you just the state while ignoring the other returned item.
   
2. If `env.step(action)` is returning five things, then you'll need to unpack all five, even if you don't use the last two (`foo, bar` in your code). Alternatively, you could use a "throwaway" variable like `_` to ignore values you don't need: `next_state, reward, done, _, _ = env.step(action)`.

Glad to hear your code is working now!

## Discretize

Certainly! The `zip` function takes two or more iterable objects and returns an iterator that generates tuples containing elements from the input iterables. In this case, `zip(state, bins)` takes elements from `state` and `bins` one-by-one and creates a tuple `(dimension, bin_edges)` for each pair.

Let's say `state` is `[0.5, 0.1, -0.2, 0.3]`, which represents the current state of the environment as a four-dimensional vector (cart position, cart velocity, pole angle, pole angular velocity). And let's say `bins` is a list of four arrays that represent the bin edges for each of these dimensions.

Here's a simplified example:

```python
state = [0.5, 0.1, -0.2, 0.3]
bins = [
    [-4.8, -3.2, -1.6, 0, 1.6, 3.2, 4.8],  # for cart position
    [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4],  # for cart velocity
    [-0.418, -0.209, 0, 0.209, 0.418],  # for pole angle
    [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4]  # for pole angular velocity
]
```

The `for-loop` goes through each dimension of the `state` and its corresponding `bin_edges`:

1. First iteration: `dimension = 0.5, bin_edges = [-4.8, -3.2, -1.6, 0, 1.6, 3.2, 4.8]`
2. Second iteration: `dimension = 0.1, bin_edges = [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4]`
3. Third iteration: `dimension = -0.2, bin_edges = [-0.418, -0.209, 0, 0.209, 0.418]`
4. Fourth iteration: `dimension = 0.3, bin_edges = [-4, -2, 0, 2, 4]`

Inside the loop, you would typically find the corresponding bin for each `dimension` value by checking between which `bin_edges` it falls. This way, you're discretizing each dimension of the continuous state space into a coarser representation that can be more easily managed by the Q-learning algorithm.

## What is linspace?

The `numpy.linspace` function generates linearly spaced values over a specified range. For instance, `np.linspace(start, stop, num)` will generate `num` evenly spaced samples from `start` to `stop`, inclusive.

For example:

```python
import numpy as np
np.linspace(0, 1, 5)
```

This would output `[0.  , 0.25, 0.5 , 0.75, 1.  ]`, which are 5 linearly spaced numbers from 0 to 1.

### Why those particular numbers?

The numbers in `num_bins` are derived from the observation space of the CartPole environment. The observation space consists of four variables:

1. **Cart Position**: This can range from -4.8 to 4.8. The cart moves along a track, and these are the limits for its position.
2. **Cart Velocity**: The cart can move in both directions. The velocity range is often unbounded in theory but will fall within practical limits due to the environment constraints. The range -4 to 4 is a simplified representation.
3. **Pole Angle**: Measured in radians, the pole can tilt from -0.418 to 0.418 radians (or about -24 degrees to 24 degrees).
4. **Pole Angular Velocity**: Similar to cart velocity, this isn't theoretically bounded but will fall within practical limits. Again, -4 to 4 is a simplified representation.

So, each of these ranges is divided into bins using `linspace` to create a discretized representation of what are originally continuous state spaces. For example, `np.linspace(-4.8, 4.8, 24)` generates 24 evenly spaced bins for the cart position between -4.8 and 4.8.

The choice of how many bins (`24`, `48`, etc.) is often a trade-off:

- **More bins**: The advantage is a more accurate representation of the state space, but it also means the Q-table grows in size, requiring more memory and computational power.
  
- **Fewer bins**: This would reduce the Q-table's size but might result in a less accurate representation of the state space, possibly affecting the learning performance.

Understanding these trade-offs is crucial, and the choice of bins often depends on the specific problem you're tackling, the resources you have, and the level of accuracy you need.
