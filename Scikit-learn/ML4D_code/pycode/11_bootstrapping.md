## Out-of-Bootstrap Error Rate

This code generates a bootstrapped sample and calculates an out-of-bootstrap estimate of the error rate of the sample.

First, the code imports the necessary libraries `random` and `numpy`. Then, a variable `n` is set to 1000, which represents the number of examples. A set `examples` is created with the range of `n`, i.e., `examples` contains integers from 0 to 999.

The `for` loop runs 10,000 times, and in each iteration, a boostrapped sample of size `n` is generated using the `randint` function from the `random` library. The list `chosen` contains the indices of the examples in the boostrapped sample.

Then, the code calculates the out-of-bootstrap error rate for this sample. This is done by finding the intersection of the original set of examples (`examples`) and the boostrapped sample (`chosen`), and subtracting the size of the intersection from the size of the original set. The result is divided by `n` to get the proportion of examples that are not in the intersection. This calculation is performed for each iteration of the `for` loop, and the resulting error rates are stored in the list `results`.

Finally, the mean of the error rates in `results` is calculated using `np.mean` from the `numpy` library and printed as a percentage.

```py
from random import randint

import numpy as np

n = 1000  # number of examples

# your original set of examples
examples = set(range(n))
results = list()

for j in range(10000):
    # your bootstrapped sample
    chosen = [randint(0, n) for k in range(n)]

    # out-of-sample
    results.append((1000 - len(set(chosen) & examples)) / float(n))

print("\nOut-of-boostrap: %0.1f %%" % (np.mean(results) * 100))

# Out-of-boostrap: 36.8 %
```

## Summary

This code creates a pretend group of 1000 things. Then it takes a smaller sample from that group, like choosing 10 things out of 1000, and does that 10,000 times.

Next, it checks how many of the things from the pretend group were not picked in any of those 10,000 samples. This is called the "out-of-bootstrap error rate".

The code calculates this rate and shows it as a percentage. This is a way to estimate how well a sample represents the whole group.

## What do the results mean?

If the out-of-bootstrap error rate is 36.8%, it means that on average, 36.8% of the things in the pretend group were not selected in any of the 10,000 samples.

A higher error rate indicates that the samples are less representative of the whole group, meaning that the sample is less reliable in reflecting the characteristics of the whole group.

So, in this case, a higher error rate suggests that the sample may not be a very good representation of the whole group.
