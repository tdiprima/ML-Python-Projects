In the context of a Gym environment with `render_mode='human'`, the Pygame display surface is created when you call `env.render()` for the first time.

If the display surface is closed or uninitialized (e.g., because you called `env.close()` or because an error occurred), any subsequent attempts to access the display surface will result in the **"display Surface quit"** error.

To avoid this error, you should make sure that you're only calling `env.render()` when the environment is open and the display surface is available.

You can do this by checking the `env._open` attribute, which is a boolean flag that indicates whether the environment is currently open.

Here's an example of how to avoid the "display Surface quit" error:

```python
import gym

env = gym.make('CartPole-v1', render_mode='human')
env.reset()

done = False
while not done:
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    observation, reward, done, _, info = env.step(action)
    
    if done:
        print("Episode finished")
        if env._open:
            env.close()
            
    if env._open:
        env.render()
```

In this example, we create an instance of the `CartPole-v1` environment with `render_mode='human'`.

We then enter a loop where we sample an action from the environment's action space and take a step in the environment.

If `done` is `True`, we print a message indicating that the episode has finished, and check if the environment is still open before calling `env.close()`.

We also check if the environment is open before calling `env.render()`, to avoid the "display Surface quit" error.

### Spinning pinwheel

Hmm... it looks like the window wants to close.  But I'm getting a spinning pinwheel.  Is there a way to error trap for that and force-close it?

If you're using the render_mode='human' option, it's possible that the window may become unresponsive or freeze, especially if you're running a long episode. In this case, you can use a try-except block to catch any exceptions that might occur when you try to close the window, and force-close it using the pygame module.

Note that this may not work if the window is completely unresponsive, in which case you may need to force-quit the Python script.

```python
import gym
import pygame

env = gym.make('CartPole-v1', render_mode='human')
env.reset()

done = False
while not done:
    action = env.action_space.sample()
    observation, reward, done, _, info = env.step(action)
    
    # Close the window when done/terminated=True
    if done:
        print("Episode finished")
        try:
            env.close()
        except:
            pygame.quit()
```
