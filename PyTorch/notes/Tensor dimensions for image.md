## Tensor dimensions for image

<span style="color:blue;font-size:larger;">In PyTorch, if I create a random tensor like `torch.rand(size=(3, 3, 3))`, as if I were to create a dummy image, am I passing in (height, width, color channels), or (color channels, height, width)?</span>

In PyTorch, when you create a tensor using `torch.rand(size=(3, 3, 3))`, the dimensions of the tensor depend on how you interpret them in the context of an image. Typically, in PyTorch, image data is represented in the format <mark>**(channels, height, width)**</mark>, especially when working with models in the field of computer vision.

So, in your example:

- If you intend to represent an image, the tensor dimensions are interpreted as (color channels, height, width). This means you have 3 color channels (e.g., RGB), and each channel is a 3x3 grid.

- However, if you don't specifically associate these dimensions with image data, they are just dimensions of a 3-dimensional tensor without any inherent meaning of height, width, or channels.

It's important to note that this (channels, height, width) format is a convention in PyTorch and differs from some other libraries or image formats where the order might be (height, width, channels).
