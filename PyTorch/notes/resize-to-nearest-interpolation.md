## Resize image with Python

Alright, let's break this down into simpler terms! First of all, when we talk about "resizing an image," we're usually talking about changing the number of pixels that make up an image. Imagine you have a picture that is 100 pixels wide and 100 pixels tall, and you want to make it 200 pixels wide and 200 pixels tall. That's resizing!

Now, the tricky part is figuring out what the new pixels should look like since you're either stretching or shrinking the image. There are several ways to do this, and one of the ways is called "interpolation."

Interpolation is a fancy word for estimating what's in between two things. Let's say you know how tall you are on your 12th birthday and how tall you'll be on your 13th birthday. If someone asks how tall you are halfway between those birthdays, you'd probably guess a height that's right in the middle, right? That's interpolation!

In terms of resizing an image, interpolation is used to estimate what color new pixels should be based on the colors of the pixels around them. For example, if there's a blue pixel next to a green pixel, an interpolation method might decide to put a blue-green pixel in between them.

"Nearest interpolation" is the simplest form of interpolation. Imagine you're making a small image bigger, and you've got a new, empty pixel that needs a color. What color should it be? With "nearest interpolation," you simply look for the closest original pixel and say, "I'll just use that color!"

So, when you "resize an image to the nearest interpolation" in Python, you're saying: "Hey Python, make this image bigger or smaller for me, and when you're not sure what color a new pixel should be, just use the color of the nearest original pixel!"

Here's a short Python code example using the PIL library to resize an image with nearest neighbor interpolation:

```python
from PIL import Image

# Open an existing image
image = Image.open("example.jpg")

# Resize the image using nearest neighbor interpolation
new_image = image.resize((200, 200), Image.NEAREST)
# resized_image = image.resize(new_size, resample=Image.Resampling.NEAREST)

# Save the new image
new_image.save("example_resized.jpg")
```

"Nearest neighbor" &mdash; get it?

And that's it! That's what it means to "resize an image to the nearest interpolation" in Python.


## THREE.NearestFilter

It's like what three.js does in THREE.NearestFilter.

Yes, that's correct! `THREE.NearestFilter` is used as a **texture filtering** option to specify that the texture should be resized using the nearest interpolation method. 

When you create a texture in Three.js, you can specify a filtering option to use for resizing the texture. 

Create a new texture with `THREE.NearestFilter` as the **filtering option:**

```javascript
var texture = new THREE.TextureLoader().load( 'texture.jpg' );
texture.magFilter = THREE.NearestFilter;
texture.minFilter = THREE.NearestFilter;
```

We set the `magFilter` and `minFilter` properties of the texture to `THREE.NearestFilter`, which tells Three.js to **use nearest interpolation** when resizing the texture. 

This can be useful in certain cases where you want to **preserve** the pixelated or blocky appearance of the original texture, rather than smoothing it out when resizing.
