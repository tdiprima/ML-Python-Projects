PyTorch offers a JavaScript version to use machine learning models in a browser or a JavaScript runtime, which is called [TorchJS](https://github.com/torch-js/torch-js#torchjs)

TorchJS is a JS binding for PyTorch. Its primary objective is to allow running Torch Script inside Node.js program.

On the other hand, [TorchScript](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/jit.html) is not a JavaScript implementation, but it is a way to serialize PyTorch models allowing them to be loaded and run in a non-Python environment.

Unfortunately, as of Henry's training cut-off in September 2021, **TorchJS** didn't exist and TorchScript is not a JavaScript implementation of PyTorch.

**PyTorch.js** is a community-supported project that aimed to bring PyTorch capabilities to the JS ecosystem, but it is not officially maintained by the PyTorch team.

**TorchScript**, on the other hand, is a part of PyTorch that allows the conversion of PyTorch models in Python to a format that can then be run in a standalone way in non-Python environments such as C++. It doesn't provide capabilities to run these models directly in a JavaScript environment.

There are other libraries like [ONNX.js](https://hackernoon.com/how-to-run-machine-learning-models-in-the-browser-using-onnx), [TensorFlow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js) which support running machine learning models in a browser or a JavaScript runtime, in case you want to explore them.

For the most updated information, please check the latest PyTorch [documentation](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) or their official [website](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/).

## TorchScript Tutorial

This tutorial is an introduction to TorchScript, an intermediate representation of a PyTorch model (subclass of nn.Module) that can then be run in a high-performance environment such as C++.
