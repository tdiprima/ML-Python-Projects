## PyTorch App Example

<span style="color:#0000dd;">Can you give me an example TorchScript app?</span>

Sure, let's create a simple PyTorch app and convert it to TorchScript. For simplicity, let's assume that we have a PyTorch model that classifies an image as a cat or dog. 

First, you train your model in PyTorch:

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# For example, a simple binary classifier
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 6, 5)
        self.pool = nn.MaxPool2d(2, 2)
        self.conv2 = nn.Conv2d(6, 16, 5)
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(16 * 5 * 5, 120)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(120, 84)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(84, 2)

    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv1(x)))
        x = self.pool(F.relu(self.conv2(x)))
        x = x.view(-1, 16 * 5 * 5)
        x = F.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = F.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = self.fc3(x)
        return x

net = Net()
criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.001, momentum=0.9)

# Insert here your training loop, loading data, backpropagation, etc.
# Then save your trained model
torch.save(net.state_dict(), 'cat_dog_model.pth')
```

Next, you can convert this model into TorchScript and save it:

```python
scripted_model = torch.jit.script(net)
torch.jit.save(scripted_model, "cat_dog_model_scripted.pth")
```

<br>
Finally, you can load the TorchScript model and run it in a standalone app:

```python
# A standalone app that uses the TorchScript model
def classify_image(img_path):
    # Loading the TorchScript model
    scripted_model = torch.jit.load("cat_dog_model_scripted.pth")

    # Assuming that the image is already normalized and resized
    from PIL import Image
    from torchvision import transforms

    transform = transforms.Compose([
        transforms.Resize((32, 32)),
        transforms.ToTensor(),
        transforms.Normalize((0.5, 0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5, 0.5)),
    ])

    img = Image.open(img_path)
    img_t = transform(img)
    batch_t = torch.unsqueeze(img_t, 0)

    # Running the model
    out = scripted_model(batch_t)
    _, index = torch.max(out, 1)

    return "cat" if index[0] == 0 else "dog"

# Using the app
print(classify_image("test_image.jpg"))
```

<br>

In this simple application, the `classify_image` function takes as input an image path, transforms the image, runs the pre-trained TorchScript model on the image, and outputs whether the image is a cat or a dog.

This is a very simplistic example. In practice, your model would be more complex and you'd need to handle more edge cases. But this should give you an idea of how you can use TorchScript to deploy PyTorch models.
