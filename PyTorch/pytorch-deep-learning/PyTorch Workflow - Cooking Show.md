### Torch Flow

1. Get data ready
2. Build a model
    * Pick loss function & optimizer
    * Training loop 
3. Fit model to data (training)
4. Make predictions and evaluate model
5. Save model

### Analogy using cooking steps <span style="font-size:27px;">üë©‚Äçüç≥</span>

1. Get ingredients ready (similar to getting data ready)
2. Develop a recipe (similar to building a model)
    * Spices (cost, optimizer, forward)
3. Cook the dish according to the recipe (similar to fitting the model to the data)
4. Taste the dish and adjust seasoning as necessary (similar to making predictions and evaluating the model)
5. Store the leftover dish for later (similar to saving the model)

I hope this helps you remember the steps!
