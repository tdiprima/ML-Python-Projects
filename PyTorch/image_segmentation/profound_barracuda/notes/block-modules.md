## PyTorch ModuleList with Block

How does this work?

```ruby
channels = (3, 16, 32, 64)

self.encBlocks = ModuleList(
    [Block(channels[i], channels[i + 1])
     for i in range(len(channels) - 1)]
)
```

This is a Python code snippet that **creates a list of `Block` modules** using the `ModuleList` class from the PyTorch library.

`self` refers to an instance of a **PyTorch `nn.Module` class.** The `nn.Module` class is a base class for all neural network modules in PyTorch, and it provides many useful methods and attributes for building neural networks.

The `ModuleList` class is a **container for `nn.Module` objects** that allows them to be treated as a single module. In this case, it is used to group a list of `Block` modules together.

The list of `Block` modules is created using a Python list comprehension, which **creates a new `Block` module for each pair of adjacent values in the `channels` list.**

The `Block` constructor takes two arguments: `channels[i]` and `channels[i+1]`, which represent the **input and output channel dimensions** of the block, respectively.

So, the overall effect of this code is to create a list of `Block` modules that will be used as the encoding layers of a neural network. Each `Block` module will take an input tensor with `channels[i]` channels and produce an output tensor with `channels[i+1]` channels.
