## Pinning memory for performance

In PyTorch, **"pinning memory during data loading"** is a technique used to improve the performance of loading data into the GPU memory. 

When data is loaded into PyTorch, it is usually loaded into the CPU memory first and then transferred to the GPU memory. However, the transfer process can be slow because the CPU and GPU have separate memory spaces, and data needs to be copied from one to the other.

To improve the performance of data loading, PyTorch provides a feature called "pinned memory". Pinned memory is a special type of memory that is allocated in the CPU memory and can be directly accessed by the GPU without the need for data to be copied.

By pinning the memory during data loading, we can avoid the overhead of copying data from CPU to GPU memory, which can significantly speed up the loading process. This is particularly useful when working with large datasets or when loading data in a multi-threaded environment.

To pin the memory during data loading in PyTorch, we can use the `pin_memory` argument when creating a DataLoader object:

```py
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader

# create a dataset
dataset = ...

# create a DataLoader with pinned memory
dataloader = DataLoader(dataset, pin_memory=True, ...)
```

Setting `pin_memory=True` will create a DataLoader that loads data into pinned memory, which can then be directly accessed by the GPU.
