## CV2 DataLoader Error

The dataset was corrupt.  Like geez, Kaggle... ðŸ˜’

```sh
find . -iname "._*" -exec rm -- "{}" \;
```

I created a pytorch DataLoader `train_loader`.  When I go to train it using `for (i, (x, y)) in enumerate(train_loader):` it works on my machine, but on a server I'm getting an error on it.  But it's a `Type <class 'cv2.error'>` error.  It says "Caught error in DataLoader worker process 0."

The error you are encountering suggests that there might be **an issue with the images** that you are trying to load with **OpenCV** (`cv2`). This could be due to a variety of reasons, such as:

1. The images are corrupted or not in a supported format.
2. There is not enough memory to load the images.
3. There is a compatibility issue with the version of OpenCV installed on the server.

To debug this issue, you can try the following steps:

1. **Check the file paths:** Make sure that the file paths you are using to load the images are correct and accessible on the server. You can print the file paths using `print(x)` in your loop to verify that the file paths are correct.

2. **Check the image format:** Verify that the images you are trying to load are in a supported format. OpenCV supports a wide range of image formats, such as JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc. You can check the file extension using `os.path.splitext()` and verify that it is a supported format.

3. **Check the image size:** Verify that the images are not too large for the memory available on the server. You can use the `cv2.imread()` function to load a single image and check its size using the `shape` attribute.

4. **Check the version of OpenCV:** Verify that the version of OpenCV installed on the server is compatible with your code. You can check the version using `cv2.__version__`.

5. **Try a smaller subset of the data:** If the above steps do not work, try using a smaller subset of the data to identify if the issue is with a specific image or a more general problem.
