## PythonML is Fun

This repo contains the Python code for a number of **machine learning algorithms** such as Decision Trees and SVM (Support Vector Machines).

There is also code for **artificial neural networks** (ANN) and Deep Learning applications such as CNN.

The **deep learning applications** have been demonstrated using the Keras library.
