## ML for Aphasia

**Machine learning** is when computers learn to do things by themselves **without being explicitly programmed** to do so.

It's kind of like when you **learn how to ride a bike** - at first, someone helps you and tells you what to do, but eventually, you get better at it and can ride by yourself without any help. <span style="font-size: 30px;">🚴‍♀️</span>

Now, when it comes to Aphasia, machine learning can be used to **help people who have trouble with their language.** <span style="font-size: 30px;">🤟</span>

For example, let's say someone has trouble **remembering certain words or phrases.** <span style="font-size: 30px;">💬</span>

Machine learning algorithms can be **trained to recognize** those words or phrases and **suggest** them when the person is having trouble remembering. <span style="font-size: 30px;">🗣️</span>

To **train the algorithm,** lots of examples of the words or phrases would be given to the computer. 

The computer would then **look for patterns** and **similarities** among the examples and use that information to make **predictions** about new words or phrases that it hasn't seen before. <span style="font-size: 30px;">🧩</span>

**The more examples** the computer is given, **the better it gets** at recognizing and suggesting the right words or phrases.

And over time, with enough practice, it can become very good at helping people with Aphasia **communicate more effectively.** <span style="font-size: 30px;">👏</span>
