I'd be happy to explain cross-entropy to you!

In machine learning, we often want to teach a computer program how to classify things correctly. For example, if we want the program to be able to tell the difference between pictures of cats and pictures of dogs, we need to train it using a lot of examples of each.

When we're training the program, we want to make sure that it's getting better over time. One way we can measure how well it's doing is by using something called cross-entropy.

Cross-entropy is like a score that tells us how close the program's guesses are to the correct answers. The closer the guesses are, the lower the cross-entropy score.

Imagine you have a friend who's trying to guess what animal you're thinking of, and you can only give them "yes" or "no" answers to their questions. If they ask you "does it have fur?", and the animal you're thinking of does have fur, you would say "yes". If they guess "snake", you would say "no".

Cross-entropy is like counting how many "no" answers your friend gets before they finally guess the right animal. The lower the number of "no" answers, the closer your friend was to guessing the right animal.

So in machine learning, we use cross-entropy to see how close the program's guesses are to the correct answers. The lower the cross-entropy score, the better the program is doing!
