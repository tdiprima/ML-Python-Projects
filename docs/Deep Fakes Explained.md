## Deep Fakes Explained

Have you ever seen a magic trick where a magician makes something disappear or someone appear out of nowhere? Well, deep fakes are kind of like a magic trick, but with videos.

Deep fakes are videos that have been made to look like they show something that actually didn't happen. For example, someone could use special computer programs to make a video of someone saying or doing something that they never actually said or did.

These videos can be really convincing and look very real, which can be a problem because some people might believe them and think that they're true. That's why it's important to always be careful and try to make sure that the things you see and hear online are actually true.
