## Training a Neural Network

When TensorFlow trains a model with `model.fit()`, it prints one output per epoch.

Can you explain what this means:<br>
`loss: 1.7329 - accuracy: 0.2883 - val_loss: 1.3650 - val_accuracy: 0.4048`?

### What's the difference between loss and val_loss?

Yes, I can explain what the output means when TensorFlow trains a model using the `model.fit()` method.

The output you see during the training of a neural network with `model.fit()` typically includes several metrics that help you track the performance of the model.

In the example you provided, the output includes four different metrics:

1. loss
1. accuracy
1. val_loss
1. val_accuracy

**`loss`** refers to the value of the loss function, which is a measure of how well the model is performing on the training data. The goal of training a neural network is to minimize the value of the loss function, so you want to see this value decrease as the model trains.

**`accuracy`** refers to the accuracy of the model on the training data. This metric tells you the percentage of the training examples that the model classified correctly.

**`val_loss`** refers to the value of the loss function on a validation set, which is a subset of the data that is not used for training but is used to evaluate the model's performance. The purpose of using a validation set is to detect overfitting, which occurs when the model becomes too specialized to the training data and doesn't generalize well to new data.

**`val_accuracy`** refers to the accuracy of the model on the validation set. This metric tells you how well the model is generalizing to new data.

<mark>The difference between `loss` and `val_loss` is that</mark>

**`loss`** is computed on the **training data**, while 

**`val_loss`** is computed on the **validation** data.

The **`loss`** metric tells you how well the model is **fitting the training data**,

while the **`val_loss`** metric tells you how well the model is **generalizing to new data.**

Ideally, you want both `loss` and `val_loss` to decrease as the model trains, but if `val_loss` starts to increase while `loss` continues to decrease, it's a sign that the model is **overfitting**; and you may need to adjust the model architecture or hyperparameters to improve generalization.

## Is the "validation data" typically the "test" data?

<span style="color:red;font-weight:bold;">No,</span>
the validation data is not typically the same as the test data, although they serve similar but distinct purposes in the training of a neural network.

The purpose of the **validation set** is to evaluate the performance of the model during the **training process** and to help prevent overfitting. The validation set is a subset of the training data that is not used during the actual training process but is used to evaluate the model's performance after each training epoch. This allows you to monitor the model's progress and make adjustments as necessary to improve its performance on new data.

On the other hand, the **test data** is a completely separate dataset that is used to **evaluate the final performance** of the trained model after all training is complete. The test data is typically not used in any way during the training process, and is only used at the very end to provide an unbiased estimate of how well the model will perform on new, unseen data.

So while the validation set and test set are both used to evaluate the performance of the model, they are used at different stages of the training process and serve slightly different purposes.

## test size = validation size

To make it more confusing.

So in scikit-learn's `train_test_split`, when we do `test_size=0.1`, that's really setting data aside for the validation part?

Yes, when you use scikit-learn's `train_test_split` function and set the `test_size` parameter to a value less than 1.0, you are setting aside a portion of your data as a **validation set.**

By default, `train_test_split` splits the data into a training set and a test set, with the test set being used for the final evaluation of the model after training is complete. However, if you specify a `test_size` less than 1.0, then a portion of the data is reserved as a validation set, which can be used during the training process to monitor the model's performance and prevent overfitting.

For example, if you set `test_size=0.1`, then `train_test_split` will split your data into a training set containing 90% of the data, and a validation set containing the remaining 10%. You can use the training set to train your model, and the validation set to evaluate its performance and make adjustments as necessary.

It's important to note, however, that the validation set should not be used for final model evaluation or tuning of hyperparameters. Once you have trained and validated your model, you should use a separate test set to get an unbiased estimate of its performance on new, unseen data.
