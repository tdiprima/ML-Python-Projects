Sure, I can explain it to you in a way that's easy to understand!

Imagine you have a picture that you want to analyze using a computer. To do that, you can use something called a convolutional neural network (CNN). A CNN looks at different parts of the picture, called "features," to figure out what's in the picture.

When a CNN looks at a feature, it doesn't just look at that one spot in the picture. It looks at a bunch of spots around it too, because that can help it figure out what the feature is. That's where "convolutions" come in. A convolution is like a filter that slides across the picture, looking at each feature and the spots around it.

Now, imagine that the picture you want to analyze is really small, like a tiny square. When the convolutional filter slides across the picture, it's going to go off the edge of the picture pretty quickly, and then it won't have anything else to look at. That's not good, because the CNN might miss important features that are near the edge of the picture.

That's where "padded convolutions" come in. When you use padded convolutions, you add some extra space around the edges of the picture. That way, when the convolutional filter slides across the picture, it can keep looking at the features near the edge. This can help the CNN do a better job of analyzing the picture and finding all the features.

So, in summary, padded convolutions are a way of adding some extra space around the edges of a picture to make sure that a convolutional neural network can analyze all the features in the picture, even if they're near the edge.
