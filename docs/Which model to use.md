### Machine learning algorithms 🤖

* Linear regression
* Logistic regression
* Decision trees
* Random forests
* Support vector machines
* K-nearest neighbors
* Neural networks
* Etc.

It's worth noting that some machine learning algorithms use parameters that are set to a value of 50 or multiples of 50.

For example, the **k-nearest neighbors algorithm** uses a parameter **k** that specifies the number of nearest neighbors to consider when making predictions, and this value could be set to 50 or a multiple of 50.

However, the value of k is typically chosen based on cross-validation or other model selection techniques, rather than being set to a fixed value.

### How do you know which algorithm to use?

To select the appropriate algorithm, you should consider the **type of data** you have and **what** you're trying to **predict.**

In some cases, you may need to **experiment** with multiple algorithms to see which one works best for your particular problem.

### Linear Regression <span style="font-size: 27px;">📈</span>

This algorithm is used when you want to predict a **continuous numeric value**

e.g., Predicting the price of a house based on its square footage. <span style="font-size: 30px;">🏠 🔮</span>

Linear Regression is a good choice when the **relationship** between the **input variables** and the **output variable** is **linear**.

See: [Linear Relationships in Data](Linear Relationship Graph.md)

### Classification <span style="font-size: 30px;">🏷️</span>

This algorithm is used when you want to predict a **categorical label.**

e.g., Whether an email is spam or not. <span style="font-size: 27px;">📧</span>

Classification is a good choice when the output variable is **discrete** or **categorical**.

See: [Output Variables](Output Variables.md)

### Clustering <span style="font-size: 27px;">🏘️</span>

This algorithm is used when you want to **group similar** data points together.

e.g., Grouping customers into segments based on their purchasing habits. <span style="font-size: 27px;">💵 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦</span>

Clustering is a good choice when you have a large dataset and want to identify **patterns** or groupings in the data.

### Hidden Markov Models 😶‍🌫️

This algorithm is used when you want to model a **sequence of events** or **observations.**

e.g., Predicting the **weather** based on past observations. <span style="font-size: 27px;">☀️ ⛈️ 🌨️</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 32px;">🌬️</span>

Hidden Markov Models are a good choice when the data is **sequential** and there are **hidden states** that affect the observations.
