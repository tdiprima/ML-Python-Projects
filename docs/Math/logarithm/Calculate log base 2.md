### Calculate Log Base 2 Of 8 In Python

You can use the `math` module in Python to calculate the logarithm of a number.

```py
import math

log_value = math.log2(8)

print(log_value)
```

This will output `3.0`, which is the logarithm base 2 of 8.


### Calculate Log Base 2 Of 8 In JavaScript

You can use the `Math.log2()` method in JavaScript to calculate the logarithm of a number to the base 2.

```js
let logValue = Math.log2(8);

console.log(logValue);
```

This will output `3`, which is the logarithm base 2 of 8. 

Note that the `Math.log2()` method returns the result as an integer instead of a floating-point number, so it may not be an exact value.

### Calculate Log Base 2 Of 8 In R

You can calculate the logarithm of a number to a specific base using the `log()` function with the appropriate base as the second [argument].

```r
log2(8)
```

### Log Base 2 Of 8

"Log base 2 of 8" means the exponent you need to raise 2 to, to get 8 as the result.

In other words: **2 to the power of what equals 8?**

logâ‚‚(8) = x

Here, x is the exponent that we need to find.

To solve this equation, we need to ask ourselves, "What power of 2 equals 8?"

We know that 2Â³ (2 raised to the power of 3) is equal to 8.

Therefore, log base 2 of 8 is equal to 3.

**Logs just isolate exponents** - no big deal!

Log scales are great for plotting "fold change".  (Symmetrical, equidistant.)

**The mean of logs,** aka The Geometric Mean, is great for log based data.

(i.e. when something is doubling every unit of time)

and is less sensitive to outliers.

The log of **multiplication** = **adding** exponents.

logâ‚‚(2x4) = logâ‚‚(2<sup>1</sup>/2<sup>2</sup>) = 1 + 2 = 3

The log of **division** = **subtracting** exponents. 

logâ‚‚(2/4) = logâ‚‚(2<sup>1</sup>/2<sup>2</sup>) = 1 - 2 = -1

# ðŸ›¸ ðŸ‘¾ ðŸš€

Here's the weird thing... there is no value for log2(0).

This is because there is no exponent, x, for 2 such that... 2<sup>x</sup> = 0 <br>

```py
math.log(0, 2)
# Error
```

```r
log2(0)
# -Inf or -Infinity
```

If we set x to -1000, we just get <br>

1/2<sup>1000</sup>

This is a tiny number, but it's still greater than 0.

### What does this logarithmic expression mean: logâ‚‚(2x4)

logâ‚‚(2x4) = the logarithm with base 2 of the quantity 2x4.

You can simplify the quantity inside the logarithm first by multiplying 2 and 4, which gives:

2x4 = 8

logâ‚‚(2x4) can be written as logâ‚‚(8)

logâ‚‚(2x4) = 3

```py
import math

x = 2*4
result = math.log(x, 2)
print(result)
```
