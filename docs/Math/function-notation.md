## Function notation clarification

### What does this mean? 洧녭洧녽(洧논)

The notation 洧녭洧녽(洧논) typically means that the function 洧녭 takes two arguments, 洧논 and 洧녽, and returns some output value. It's possible that 洧녭 and 洧녽 are themselves functions, in which case the expression 洧녭洧녽(洧논) means "apply the function 洧녭 to the arguments 洧녽 and 洧논". The order in which the arguments are written can depend on the convention used in a particular context or discipline. For example, in some mathematical contexts, the arguments might be written in the opposite order, as 洧녭(洧녽,洧논). Without additional information or context, it's not possible to say for sure what 洧녭洧녽(洧논) means.


### Well, they were discussing logits, and...

They were discussing logits in deep learning, and someone said "Logit is referred to the output of a function just before its normalization. So if for label 洧녽 we have score 洧녭洧녽(洧논) ..."

So I wanna know how to pronounce 洧녭洧녽(洧논) in English, and what the heck it means.

In this context, 洧녭洧녽(洧논) would be pronounced "eff sub why of ex".

It means that given some input value 洧논, the function 洧녭 generates a set of output scores for each possible label, one of which is 洧녽.

So 洧녭洧녽(洧논) represents the score or logit assigned by the function 洧녭 to the label 洧녽 for the input 洧논.

<span style="color:#997fff;">It's like the function signature; denoting the function, its arguments, and return variable.</span>

These logits can then be normalized using the softmax function to obtain a probability distribution over the possible labels.

In other words, the softmax function takes the logits as input and maps them to a set of probabilities that add up to one, representing the model's estimate of the likelihood of each label given the input 洧논.

### See: [What does the logit value actually mean?](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/52825/what-does-the-logit-value-actually-mean#498922)

Logit: "The (unnormalized) score for a label or (functional confidence) for a specific class/label."

Logit is referred to **the output of a function** (e.g. a Neural Net) **just before its normalization** (which we usually use the softmax).
