## Geometric mean <span style="font-size: 27px;">üìê ‚®è

The **geometric mean** is another type of average that's commonly used in mathematics and statistics.

It is calculated by taking the **nth root** of the **product of n numbers**.

It is often used to find the **average growth rate** or **compound interest rate** over a set of numbers.

Let's say we want to find the geometric mean of the numbers 2, 4, 6, and 8:

```py
# Import the math module
import math

# Define a list of numbers
numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]

# Calculate the product of the numbers
product = 1
for num in numbers:
    product *= num

# Calculate the geometric mean
geometric_mean = math.pow(product, 1/len(numbers))

# Print the result
print("The geometric mean is:", geometric_mean)
```

<br>
In this example, the math module is imported to use the <mark>**`pow()`** function, which takes the **nth root** of a number.</mark>

The product of the numbers is calculated using a for loop that multiplies each number together.

Then, the geometric mean is calculated by taking the product to the power of `1/n`, where `n` is the number of numbers in the list.

## Geometric Mean is calculated by taking the nth root of the product of n numbers.

First, let's talk about what a "mean" is. A mean is a type of average. It's a way of figuring out what the **"typical" value** is when you have a bunch of different numbers.

There are different types of means, but the most common one you've probably heard of is the **"arithmetic mean."** That's the one you get by **adding up** all the numbers and then **dividing by how many** numbers there are.

The geometric mean is a different type of mean. To calculate the geometric mean, you need to multiply all the numbers together, and then take the **nth root of the result.**

### Example

Let's say you have three numbers: 2, 4, and 8.

To calculate the geometric mean of these numbers, you first multiply them together: `2 x 4 x 8 = 64`.

```js
let arr = [ 2, 4, 8 ]
let product = 1;

for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
  product *= arr[i];
}

console.log(product);
```

Or:

```js
// JavaScript Array reduce() Example
let array = [ 2, 4, 8 ];

let pro = array.reduce(function(a, b) {
  return a * b;
});

console.log(pro);
```

<br>
Next, you take the **nth root** of that result. 

The "n" in this case is the **number of numbers** you're working with, which is **3** in this example.

So you take the **cube root of 64**, which is 4.

```js
let len = arr.length;

// Math.pow(n, 1/root);
// Math.pow(64, 1/3);
let result = Math.pow(product, 1/len);

// We already know we want the cube root:
Math.cbrt(64);
```

<br>
So, the geometric mean of the numbers 2, 4, and 8 is 4.

That means that <mark>**4** is the **"typical" value**</mark> when you're looking at these numbers using the **geometric mean.**


## Why is it called geometric?

The term "geometric" in "geometric mean" comes from the fact that it is related to the <span style="color: green; font-weight:bold; font-size: larger">calculation of lengths, areas, and volumes in geometry.</span>

If you have two positive numbers `a` and `b`, the **arithmetic mean** of a and b is

<span style="color: blue; font-weight:bold; font-size: larger">(a + b) / 2</span>

The **geometric mean** of a and b is

<span style="color: blue; font-weight:bold; font-size: larger">the square root of ab</span>

The square root of ab represents the **length of the side of a square** whose area is equal to the product of a and b.

In higher dimensions, the geometric mean can be thought of as the **nth root** of the **product of n numbers.**

And it can be related to the **volume of a hypercube** whose side lengths are given by the n numbers.

So while the geometric mean may not involve actual shapes like squares or cubes, it is related to the **calculation of geometric quantities** and has a geometric interpretation in terms of lengths, areas, and volumes.
