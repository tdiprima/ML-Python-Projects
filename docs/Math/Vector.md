## What is a Vector

If you're driving a car, your velocity is a vector quantity because it has both a 

* magnitude: how fast you're going
* direction: which way you're heading

### Car Velocity

"The car is moving with a velocity of 60 kilometers per hour to the east."

This sentence indicates both the magnitude (60 kilometers per hour) and the direction (to the east) of the car's velocity, which are the two components necessary to fully describe velocity as a vector quantity.

### Force vector

Here's how you might describe a force vector in a sentence:

"The object experiences a force of 50 newtons directed upwards."

This sentence tells us the magnitude (50 newtons) and the direction (upwards) of the force, which are the two components necessary to fully describe force as a vector quantity.

## Who the h3ll cares?

Because vectors + tensors.  See: <a href="../Tensors/dimensions.md">dimensions.md</a>
