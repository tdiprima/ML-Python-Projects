## What is a Vector

Okay.  I guess the opposite of scalar is vector.  They say that a vector has magnitude and direction.  So that just means... *physics*... right?

That's right! In physics, we use the concept of vectors to describe things that have both magnitude (size or amount) and direction.

For example, if you're driving a car, your velocity is a vector quantity because it has both a 

* magnitude: how fast you're going
* direction: which way you're heading

Another example of a vector quantity is force - it has both a magnitude (how strong it is) and a direction (which way it's pushing or pulling).

Vectors are really important in physics because they allow us to describe **how things are moving and interacting with each other** in a much more precise way than we could with just scalar quantities.

Magnitude = _How far_ it's going

Direction = _Which way_ it's going

**A vector has more than one number.**  F* magnitude and direction.

The way to remember how many dimensions a tensor has, is by counting the number of square brackets.

```py
vector = torch.tensor([7, 7])
vector.ndim  # 1 set of brackets
vector.shape  # 2 (it's 2 by 1 elements)
matrix = torch.tensor([[7, 8], [8, 10]])
MATRIX.ndim. # 2 (count the number of square brackets on the outside of one side)
MATRIX.shape  # [2, 2] two elements deep, two elements wide
```
