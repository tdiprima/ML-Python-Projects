## There's "power of" and "factor of"

### Factor of

When you multiply a number by 0.5, you're essentially scaling it down by a factor of 2.

When we talk about **scaling** something by a factor, we mean that we're multiplying it by a certain amount.

When we multiply a number by 0.5, we're essentially scaling it down by a factor of 2.

Why?

Because 0.5 is one-half, or one divided by two.

So if we multiply a number by 0.5, we're essentially dividing it by 2.

<span style="color: maroon; font-weight:bold; font-size: larger">10 x 0.5 = 5</span>

If we multiply a number by 2, we've increased it by a factor of 2 (i.e., we've doubled it).

And if we multiply a number by 0.5, we've decreased it by a factor of 2 (i.e., we've halved it).

### Power of

When we say we raised a number to the power of 1/3, we can say it in a few different ways, but one common way is to say **"to the power of one-third".**

In this case, "to the power of" means the same thing as "**raised** to the power of".

"One-third" means the fraction 1/3, of course.

So, if we were talking about **the cube root of 8**, we could say:

<span style="color: green; font-weight:bold">the cube root of 8 is 2</span>

because 

<span style="color: green; font-weight:bold">2 to the power of one-third equals 8</span>

And:

<span style="color: green; font-weight:bold">2 * 2 * 2 = 8</span>

## Multiply by 0.1

When we multiply a number by 0.1, it means we're finding 1/10th of that number.

For example, if we have the number 50 and we want to multiply it by 0.1, we would do:

<span style="color: maroon; font-weight:bold; font-size: larger">50 x 0.1 = 5</span>

So, when we multiply a number by 0.1, we're essentially taking 10% of that number. In other words, we're finding what number is equivalent to one-tenth of the original number.

(It's kinda like &ndash; what does "y-e-s" spell? Now what does "e-y-e-s" spell?)
