## Factor of

When we talk about **scaling** something by a factor, we mean that we're multiplying it by a certain amount.

If we multiply a number by 0.5, we've decreased it by a factor of 2 (i.e., we've halved it).

If we multiply a number by 2, we've increased it by a factor of 2 (i.e., we've doubled it).

## Power of

When we say we raised a number to the power of 1/3, we can say it in a few different ways, but one common way is to say "to the power of one-third".

In this case, "to the power of" means the same thing as "raised to the power of".

You can calculate the cube root (or any root) of a number using the exponentiation operator `**`.

Raised to the power of 3:

8^3 = 512 &check;

### Calculate the cube root of 8

```python
result = 8 ** (1/3)
print(result). # 2.0
```

### Calculate 2 to the power of 3

```python
result = 2 ** 3
print(result)  # 8
```

2 * 2 * 2 = 8

Multiplying by 0.1 doesn't mean anything other than you're getting one-tenth of the original number.

Multiplying by *1.0* probably makes the number a float.
