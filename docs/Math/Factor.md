## Factor of

When we talk about **scaling** something by a factor, we mean that we're multiplying it by a certain amount.

When we multiply a number by 0.5, we're essentially scaling it down by a factor of 2.

Why?

Because 0.5 is one-half, or one divided by two.

So if we multiply a number by 0.5, we're essentially dividing it by 2.

<span style="color: maroon; font-weight:bold; font-size: larger">10 x 0.5 = 5</span>

If we multiply a number by 2, we've increased it by a factor of 2 (i.e., we've doubled it).

And if we multiply a number by 0.5, we've decreased it by a factor of 2 (i.e., we've halved it).

## Power of

When we say we raised a number to the power of 1/3, we can say it in a few different ways, but one common way is to say **"to the power of one-third".**

In this case, "to the power of" means the same thing as "**raised** to the power of".

"One-third" means the fraction 1/3, of course.

You can calculate the cube root (or any root) of a number using the `**` operator, which is the exponentiation operator.

### Calculate the cube root of 8

```python
result = 8 ** (1/3)
print(result)
```

<br>
The cube root of 8 is 2.


### Calculate 2 to the power of 3

```python
result = 2 ** 3
print(result)
```

<br>
When you run this, it will print "8" because 2 to the power of 3 equals 8.

<center>2 * 2 * 2 equals 8</center>


## Multiply by 0.1

When we multiply a number by 0.1, it means we're finding **1/10th** of that number.

For example, if we have the number 50 and we want to multiply it by 0.1, we would do:

<span style="color: maroon; font-weight:bold; font-size: larger">50 x 0.1 = 5</span>

So, when we multiply a number by 0.1, we're essentially taking **10%** of that number. In other words, we're finding what number is equivalent to one-tenth of the original number.
