## Cube root

You can calculate the cube root of a number by using the `**` operator with &#8531; as the exponent.

```py
number = 64
cube_root = number ** (1/3)
print(cube_root)  # 4.0
```

<br>
In this example, we're calculating the cube root of 64 by raising it to the power of 1/3.

<mark>**x to the 1/n power is the same as the nth root of x.**</mark>

Note that the result is a float, not an integer, because cube roots of most numbers are not integers.

## Exponent

An exponent is a way of writing how many times you need to multiply a number by itself.

For example, <span style="color: green; font-weight:bold;">2 x 2 x 2</span> is kind of long and tedious to write.  So instead, you can use an exponent. That is, 2 multiplied by itself three times, is <span style="color: green; font-weight:bold;">2^3</span> (2 to the power of 3).


## Learning Rate

<span style="color:#0000dd;">What does 1e-4 mean?</span>

The notation "1e-4" is another way of representing a number in scientific notation, and it stands for 1 times 10 to the power of -4. The "e" here is read as "times ten to the power of."

In decimal form, 1e-4 is equal to 0.0001.

```py
learning_rate = 1e-4
```
