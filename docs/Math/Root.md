## Cube root

You can calculate the cube root of a number by using the <span style="color: #000088; font-weight:bold">**</span> operator with <span style="color: #000088;">1/3 as the exponent.</span>

```py
number = 64
cube_root = number ** (1/3)
print(cube_root)

# Answer: 4.0
```

In this example, we're calculating the cube root of 64 by raising it to the power of 1/3.

Might be helpful to know that <mark>x to the 1/n power is the same as the nth root of x. </mark>

Note that the result is a float, not an integer, because cube roots of most numbers are not integers.

## Exponent

An exponent is a way of writing how many times you need to multiply a number by itself.

For example, <span style="color: green; font-weight:bold;">2 x 2 x 2</span> is kind of long and tedious to write.  So instead, you can use an exponent. That is, 2 multiplied by itself three times, is <span style="color: green; font-weight:bold;">2^3</span> (2 to the power of 3).


## Learning Rate

<span style="color:#0000dd;">What does 1e-4 mean?</span>

The notation "1e-4" is another way of representing a number in scientific notation, and it stands for 1 times 10 to the power of -4. The "e" here is read as "times ten to the power of."

In decimal form, 1e-4 is equal to 0.0001.

```py
learning_rate = 1e-4
```

## Calculator

There's an nth root button that looks like nâˆšx

So type 64 (that's your number), press the button, then 3 (that's your root; like cube root), and press equals.

Or, you can use the exponent button.  For example, to calculate the 4th root of 81, you would press `81`, then `^`, then `1/4`, and then `=`.

Or, you can enter the fraction as a decimal.  For example, to calculate the cube root of 64 on a calculator without a fraction key, you would press `64`, then `y^x`, then `0.333`, and then `=`.
