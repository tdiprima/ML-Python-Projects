## Cube root

You can calculate the cube root of a number by using the <span style="color: #000088; font-weight:bold">**</span> operator with <span style="color: #000088; font-weight:bold">1/3 as the exponent.</span>

```py
number = 64
cube_root = number ** (1/3)
print(cube_root)

# Answer: 4.0
```

<br>
In this example, we're calculating the **cube root of 64** by **raising it to the power of 1/3.**

<mark>Might be helpful to know that **x to the 1/n power** is the same as **the nth root of x.** </mark>

Note that the result is a **float**, not an integer, because **cube roots** of most numbers are not integers.

## Exponent

An exponent is a way of writing **how many times you need to multiply a number by itself.** It's a shorthand way of writing a lot of multiplication!

Let's say you have the number 2. If you want to multiply 2 by itself three times, you can write it like this: <span style="color: green; font-weight:bold; font-size: larger">2 x 2 x 2</span>. But that's kind of long and tedious to write out every time.

So instead, you can use an **exponent**.

2 multiplied by itself three times, is <span style="color: green; font-weight:bold; font-size: larger">2^3</span>

You say: **2 to the power of 3.**

<span style="font-size: 27px;">⭐️</span> The **"3" is the exponent**, and it tells you **how many times to multiply 2 by itself.**

### Another example

Let's say you want to multiply 5 by itself four times.

You could write it like this: <span style="color: purple; font-weight:bold; font-size: larger">5 x 5 x 5 x 5</span>

But using an exponent, you can write it like this: <span style="color: purple; font-weight:bold; font-size: larger">5^4</span>

5 to the power of 4.

The "4" is the exponent, and it tells you how many times to multiply 5 by itself.


## Calculate the nth root on a calculator

Look at the [formula](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Math/cbrt), there's a button on the calculator that looks like that.

It may automagically come up with the number that, multiplied by itself (n times), equals the first number you put in.

Or:

To calculate the **nth root** of a number, you can use the **exponent button**, `^` or `x^y`, and enter the fraction `1/n` as the exponent.

For example, to calculate the **4th root of 81**, you would press `81`, then `^`, then `1/4`, and then `=`.

Or:

If your calculator doesn't have a **fraction key**, you can enter the fraction as a decimal.

For example, to calculate the cube root of 64 on a calculator without a fraction key, you would press `64`, then `y^x`, then `0.333`, and then `=`.
