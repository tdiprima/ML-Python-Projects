## Greek capital letter sigma Σ

It's a symbol used in math to represent the idea of "adding things up".

When you see the sigma symbol in a math equation, it's telling you to add up a series of numbers or terms. For example, if you saw an equation like this:

Σn

It means you need to add up all the numbers from 1 to n. So if n was 5, you would add 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5.

Another example could be:

Σx\_i

Here, it means you need to add up all the values of x\_i.

The "i" is just a way of labeling each value of x so you can keep track of them.

So, in short, the sigma symbol is a shorthand way of saying <mark>"add up all of these things".</mark>

### What that means? <span style="font-size: 25px;text-transform:lowercase;">x\_i</span>

Let's say you have a set of numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. You can represent each number in the set as x1, x2, x3, x4, and x5 respectively. So:

* x1 = 2
* x2 = 4
* x3 = 6
* x4 = 8
* x5 = 10

Now, if you see the equation Σx\_i, it means you need to add up all the values of x\_i in the set. In this case, that would be:

```
Σx_i = x1 + x2 + x3 + x4 + x5
Σx_i = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10
Σx_i = 30
```

So, Σx\_i in this case would be equal to 30.

### How do you pronounce "Σx\_i" in words?

You can pronounce Σx\_i as "the sum of x sub i" or "the sum of x with subscript i". The subscript i is just a way of distinguishing each element in the sequence or set of values that you're summing up.
