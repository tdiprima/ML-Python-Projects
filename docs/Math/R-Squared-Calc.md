## How to calculate the R-squared value

This script is creating and evaluating a simple linear regression model using the scikit-learn library in Python.

```py
# Linear Regression Model Evaluation
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create some example data
x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
y = np.array([2, 4, 5, 4, 5])

# x to 2d array
x_reshaped = x.reshape(-1, 1)

# Fit a linear regression model to the data
model = LinearRegression().fit(x_reshaped, y)

# Calculate the R-squared value
r_squared = model.score(x_reshaped, y)

print("R-squared value:", r_squared)  # 0.600
```

<br>
The R-squared value will be a number between 0 and 1, where 1 means that the model fits the data perfectly and 0 means that the model does not fit the data at all.

```c
// Train the model
model = LinearRegression().fit(x.reshape(-1, 1), y)
```

This line is creating an instance of the LinearRegression class from scikit-learn. This creates a new object that implements linear regression functionality.

Next, it's calling the `fit` method on that object, which trains the model. The parameters for the `fit` method are the input data (`x`) and the target output (`y`).

The `x.reshape(-1, 1)` is reshaping the x array into a two-dimensional array with one column and as many rows as necessary (indicated by `-1`), because the `fit` method expects a 2D array for the input data. In simpler terms, it's turning the array from a horizontal one to a vertical one.

This reshaping is needed because scikit-learn's `fit` method expects the samples to be provided as a 2D array: each row is a sample, and each column is a feature. Here, each number in x is a separate sample with one feature.

```c
// Evaluate the model
r_squared = model.score(x.reshape(-1, 1), y)
```

is evaluating the performance of the model. The `score` method in scikit-learn's regression models returns the coefficient of determination R^2 of the prediction. This is a statistical measure that indicates how well the model's predictions fit the actual data.

A value of 1.0 would indicate a perfect fit. The `score` method also takes two parameters: the input data and the target output, which are `x.reshape(-1, 1)` and `y` in this case.

The R-squared (R²) score is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance for a dependent variable that's explained by an independent variable (or variables) in a regression model. If the R² of a model is 0.50, then approximately half of the observed variation can be explained by the model's inputs.

## Plot

Yes, you can use matplotlib to visualize the linear regression model. Scikit-learn doesn't have built-in plotting functions. Here is how you could modify your script to include a plot of the data and the regression line:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Setup...

# Plot the data
plt.scatter(x, y, color='blue')  # the 2 flat arrays (for x,y coordinates)

# Calculate the y values (the line) of the regression line
regression_line = model.predict(x_reshaped)  # Predict!

# Plot the regression line
plt.plot(x, regression_line, color='red')  # x, "y", red

plt.show()
```

<br>

In this script, we're using matplotlib's `scatter` function to plot the original data points and `plot` function to draw the regression line. The `model.predict(x_reshaped)` call is used to calculate the y-values of the regression line for each x-value in the input data. The 'blue' data points represent the actual values and the 'red' line is the predicted regression line from the model.
