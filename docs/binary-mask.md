<span style="color:#0000dd;">I've imported my sample image like so:</span>

```py
from PIL import Image
from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing import image
test_image = Image.open("Formula1.jpg").convert("L")  # Do grayscale this time
img = image.img_to_array(test_image)
img = img.reshape((1,) + img.shape)
tensor = torch.from_numpy(img).float()

## Binary Mask & Permute

To generate a binary mask from an image using PyTorch, you need to first decide a threshold value. If the pixel value is greater than the threshold, it will be set to 1 (True), otherwise it will be set to 0 (False).

Once you have the tensor, you can use the `permute` function to change the order of the dimensions. In PyTorch, the standard order for images is (N, C, H, W), where N is the number of images, C is the number of color channels, H is the height in pixels, and W is the width in pixels.

Here's how you can do it:

```python
import torch

# First we convert it to grayscale (if it's not already)
# tensor = tensor.mean(dim=1, keepdim=True)  # It is already; and besides, no es bueno.

# Now, let's make the binary mask
threshold = 0.5  # Choose a threshold
mask = tensor > threshold

# Permute to (N, C, H, W)
tensor = tensor.permute(0, 3, 1, 2)

# Do the same for the mask
mask = mask.permute(0, 3, 1, 2)
```

<br>
Note: This assumes that your image is in grayscale. If it's not, you'll need to convert it to grayscale before you can threshold it. The code above does this with the `mean(dim=1, keepdim=True)` line. You should also adjust the threshold value according to your needs. I used 0.5 here as an example.

## Visualize

Yes, you can certainly visualize the mask! In Python, a popular library for image visualization is `matplotlib`. Here's how you can visualize the mask:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Convert the tensor mask to a numpy array and squeeze it to 2D
mask_np = mask.numpy().squeeze()

# Using matplotlib to display the mask
plt.imshow(mask_np, cmap='gray')
plt.show()
```

<br>

Note: The `squeeze()` function is used to remove single-dimensional entries from the shape of an array. The mask has 4 dimensions (1, 1, H, W) and `squeeze()` will reduce it to just (H, W), which is the format `imshow()` expects for 2D images. The 'gray' colormap is used to show the image in grayscale.

Also, make sure you convert the mask to CPU before converting to numpy, if you're using a GPU for computations. You can do this by calling `mask.cpu()`.
