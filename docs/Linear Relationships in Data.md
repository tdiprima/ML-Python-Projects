## Linear Relationships in Data

### How do you know if the relationship between the input variables and the output variable is linear?

Imagine you have a toy car that you can make go forward or backward by using a remote control.&nbsp;&nbsp;The car has different buttons on the remote control that you can press to make it move.

Now, let's say you want to know how pressing different buttons on the remote control affects how far the car moves.&nbsp;&nbsp;You could write down a list of which button you pressed and how far the car went each time.

If you plot this information on a graph, where the buttons you pressed are on the bottom and how far the car went is on the side, you might notice that the dots on the graph all line up in a straight line.

If the dots on the graph make a straight line like this, it means that the relationship between the button you press and how far the car goes is probably linear.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that the further you push the button, the further the car will go.

But if the dots on the graph don't make a straight line, it means that the relationship between the button you press and how far the car goes might not be linear.&nbsp;&nbsp;This means that pushing the button harder might not always make the car go further.

On this graph, the buttons you press are on the x-axis (the bottom) and how far the [car goes is on the y-axis].

### Can you show me that graph?

Sure, here's an example graph to help illustrate the idea. Let's say we want to see if there's a linear relationship between the number of hours someone studies for a test and their test score. We can plot the data on a graph, with the number of hours on the x-axis (horizontal) and the test score on the y-axis (vertical).

If the relationship between the two variables is linear, the data points will roughly form a straight line on the graph. Here's an example graph that shows a linear relationship:

You can see that the points form a straight line, which means there's a strong linear relationship between the number of hours studied and the test score. The more hours someone studies, the higher their test score tends to be.

Now, here's an example of a non-linear relationship graph. Let's say we're looking at the relationship between the diameter of a pizza and its price.

### Non-Linear Relationship Graph Example

Pretend:

<img src="http://wordpress.mrreid.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/pizza-diameter-area.png" width="400">

You can see that the points do not form a straight line, and instead form a curve. This means that there is a non-linear relationship between the diameter of the pizza and its price. In this case, the relationship might be that as the diameter of the pizza gets larger, the price increases at a decreasing rate. So a larger pizza might not cost twice as much as a smaller pizza, but more like 1.5 times as much.
