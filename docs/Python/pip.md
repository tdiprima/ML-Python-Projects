### pip reinstall

You can try reinstalling `albumentations` using the following command to ensure that all the necessary dependencies are installed:

```sh
pip install --force-reinstall albumentations
```

Force reinstall can be useful when you need to completely reinstall a package and overwrite any existing files. However, it's important to use it with caution, as it can potentially cause issues with other dependencies or packages. Always make sure to check for any potential side effects before using this option.

### How?

Before using the `--force-reinstall` option, you can check the dependencies of the package you want to reinstall and make sure that none of them are going to be affected by the reinstallation. One way to do this is to use the `pip check` command, which checks for any broken dependencies in your current environment. Here's an example:

```sh
pip check albumentations
```

This command will check the `albumentations` package and its dependencies for any broken or missing requirements.

Another option is to use the `pipdeptree` package, which can generate a dependency tree for a given package. Here's an example:

```sh
pip install pipdeptree
pipdeptree -p albumentations
```

This will generate a tree of dependencies for the `albumentations` package. You can inspect the tree to see if any of the dependencies are going to be affected by the reinstallation.

Additionally, you can also check the documentation or release notes of the package you want to reinstall to see if there are any known issues or incompatibilities with the latest version. This can help you avoid potential problems that might arise from a forced reinstallation.

Overall, it's important to exercise caution when using the `--force-reinstall` option and make sure that you understand the potential risks and side effects before proceeding.
