# TL;DR

All this works on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tammydiprima/simple-unet-pytorch/).  On Google Colab - error.  Grinder - error.  I followed the bouncing error messages, and I've got yet another error.  This is all because I told Kaggle to use GPU and it's freakin' not using it.  Yes, I did `.to(device)`.  Tried `.cuda()` - same thing; it's using freakin' CPU anyway.

One possible reason for the error is that the `albumentations` library is not installed on your system. You can try installing it by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```sh
pip install albumentations
```

If `albumentations` is already installed on your system, then the error might be due to version incompatibility. The `ToTensor` class was introduced in version 1.0.0 of `albumentations`. If you have an older version of `albumentations` installed, you can upgrade it by running:

```sh
pip install --upgrade albumentations
```

If upgrading `albumentations` does not solve the problem, then you might have to check the installation location of the `albumentations` package. It is possible that the `albumentations` package is installed in a different location than your current Python environment. You can try adding the path to the `albumentations` package to your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable, or use a virtual environment to manage your Python environment.

Finally, if none of the above solutions work, you can try importing `ToTensor` directly from the `albumentations.augmentations.transforms` module, like this:

```py
from albumentations.augmentations.transforms import ToTensor
```

If none of the previous solutions worked, you can try importing `ToTensor` directly from the `A.pytorch` module, like this:

```py
import albumentations as A
from A.pytorch import ToTensor
```

This should work as long as the `pytorch` module is available in the `A` namespace. If this still doesn't work, you can try reinstalling `albumentations` using the following command to ensure that all the necessary dependencies are installed:

```sh
pip install --force-reinstall albumentations
```

If the problem persists, you can try importing the `ToTensor` class from the <mark>**`albumentations.pytorch.transforms`**</mark> module, like this:

```py
# Then I ended up using ToTensorV2, cuz I got an error
from albumentations.pytorch.transforms import ToTensor
```

This should work if you have the latest version of `albumentations` installed. If none of these solutions work, please let me know and provide me with the specific error message you are getting.

**The <mark>`--force-reinstall`</mark> option "worked" - it got me past the import errors.**

Force reinstall can be useful when you need to completely reinstall a package and overwrite any existing files. However, it's important to use it with caution, as it can potentially cause issues with other dependencies or packages. Always make sure to check for any potential side effects before using this option. If you have any other questions or issues, feel free to ask!

Before using the `--force-reinstall` option, you can check the dependencies of the package you want to reinstall and make sure that none of them are going to be affected by the reinstallation. One way to do this is to use the `pip check` command, which checks for any broken dependencies in your current environment. Here's an example:

```sh
pip check albumentations
```

This command will check the `albumentations` package and its dependencies for any broken or missing requirements.

Another option is to use the `pipdeptree` package, which can generate a dependency tree for a given package. Here's an example:

```sh
pip install pipdeptree
pipdeptree -p albumentations
```

This will generate a tree of dependencies for the `albumentations` package. You can inspect the tree to see if any of the dependencies are going to be affected by the reinstallation.

Additionally, you can also check the documentation or release notes of the package you want to reinstall to see if there are any known issues or incompatibilities with the latest version. This can help you avoid potential problems that might arise from a forced reinstallation.

Overall, it's important to exercise caution when using the `--force-reinstall` option and make sure that you understand the potential risks and side effects before proceeding.

Using `np.bool` instead of `bool` is not recommended, as `bool` is the standard built-in boolean data type in Python. However, if you want to use `np.bool` anyway, you can convert your boolean values to `np.bool` before passing them to the function that is giving you the error.

For example, let's say you have a boolean array `my_bool_array`:

```py
import numpy as np

my_bool_array = np.array([True, False, True])
```

Instead of using `np.bool` directly in your code, you can convert the boolean array to `np.bool` using the `astype()` method:

```py
my_np_bool_array = my_bool_array.astype(np.bool)
```

Then, you can pass `my_np_bool_array` to the function that was giving you the error. This should resolve the issue without ignoring the error.

It's important to note that ignoring errors can lead to unexpected behavior in your code, and it's generally not recommended. Instead, you should try to understand the cause of the error and fix it properly. In this case, the error message suggests that the dimensions of the input tensor do not match the desired ordering of dimensions. You might want to check the documentation of the function to make sure that you are passing the correct input tensor shape and order of dimensions.

Got on my last nerve.

I did all that, and probably ***because*** of that now we've got:

```py
mask = mask[0].permute(2, 0, 1)
```

RuntimeError: permute(sparse_coo): number of dimensions in the tensor input does not match the length of the desired ordering of dimensions i.e. input.dim() = 2 is not equal to len(dims) = 3
