### Class

If I were to extract the `MyModel` class to a separate file, what is the naming convention for the file?  Should I name it `MyModel.py`?

Yes, naming the file `MyModel.py` is a common convention for a file containing a class named MyModel.

This is because Python uses the file name as the module name, and it makes it easy to import the class into another module using `from MyModel import MyModel`.

However, it is important to note that the naming convention is not a strict rule.

You can choose a different file name as long as it follows the PEP 8 style guide for Python code.

### Such as?

There are several alternative file naming conventions that you can use for Python modules that contain classes.

* If you have a module that contains multiple classes, you can use a descriptive name that reflects the contents of the module.
  * For example, if your module contains classes related to image processing, you might name it `image_processing.py`.

* If you have a module that contains a single class but the name of the class is long or complex, you might choose to name the file after the class instead of the module.
  * For example, if your class is called `MyVeryLongClassName`, you might name the file `my_very_long_class_name.py`.

* If you are following a specific naming convention for your project or organization, you should use that convention consistently across all your files.
  * For example, if your project uses a prefix for all module names, you might name your file `prefix_mymodel.py`.

Remember that the most important thing is to choose a file name that accurately reflects the contents of the module and makes it easy for other developers to understand and use your code.
