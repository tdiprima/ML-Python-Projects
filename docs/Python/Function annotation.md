What is this notation, with the arrow?

```py
def forward(self, x: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor:
    return self.linear_layer(x)
```

The notation with the arrow `->` in the function signature is called a function annotation.

It is used to specify the type of the function's **input arguments** and **return value.**

In the given example, `x: torch.Tensor` indicates that the `x` **parameter** of the forward function should be a `torch.Tensor` object.

Similarly, `-> torch.Tensor` indicates that the forward function should **return** a `torch.Tensor` object.

Function annotations are optional in Python, but they can be helpful in specifying the expected types of function arguments and return values, which can help catch type-related errors during development.

They can also be used by third-party tools for automatic type checking and code analysis.
