## Generative adversarial networks

Have you ever played a game of "guess who" with a friend? In that game, you each have a board with different characters on it, and you take turns asking yes-or-no questions to try and guess the other person's character.

Now imagine that instead of a friend, you're playing against a computer. But instead of playing "guess who," you're trying to make pictures of animals. The computer will show you a picture of an animal, and you have to draw your own picture of the same animal. The computer will then compare your picture to the original picture and tell you how close you came.

But the computer isn't just trying to help you make better pictures. It's also trying to make its own pictures of animals that are so good, you won't be able to tell the difference between them and real pictures. The computer will keep making better and better pictures, and you'll keep trying to catch up.

This is kind of like what happens in something called a "generative adversarial network," or GAN for short. It's a special kind of computer program that has two parts: one part makes pictures, and the other part tries to figure out which pictures are real and which ones are fake. The part that makes the pictures tries to make them so good that the other part can't tell the difference.

It's like a game between two players, where one player is trying to make really good fake pictures, and the other player is trying to catch them out by spotting the fakes. The two players keep playing this game over and over again, and each time they get better and better. The end result is a computer program that's really good at making realistic-looking pictures!
