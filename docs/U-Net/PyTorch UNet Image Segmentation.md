## PyTorch program that uses the UNet architecture for image segmentation

### [U-Net PyTorch X](../../TensorFlow/todo/unet-todo/unet-torch-x.py)

In this program, we've defined the U-Net architecture for image segmentation, 
and used it to train a model on the **CIFAR-10 dataset.** 

We've also defined the `train` and `validate` functions to handle training and validation, respectively. 

Finally, we've defined the `main` function to set up the device, load the data, set up the model and optimizer, and train the model for 10 epochs. 

We've also included code at the end to display some sample predictions from the model.

## Â¿Problema?

When we do `x = torch.cat([x, x1], dim=1)`, it says: 

```
Sizes of tensors must match except in dimension 1. 
Expected size 64 but got size 32 for tensor number 1 in the list. 
```

Help.

This error message is indicating that the size of the tensors that you are trying to concatenate with `torch.cat()` do not match along the non-concatenating dimension.

i.e., Dimension 1 in this case.

The error message suggests that the tensor you are trying to concatenate with, `x`, has size **32 along dimension 1.**

While `x` has **size 64** along the same dimension.

<span style="color: #000088;">You will need to investigate where this size mismatch is happening,</span>

<span style="color: #000088;">and make sure that the sizes of all tensors being concatenated</span>

<span style="color: #000088;">match along all dimensions</span>

<span style="color: #000088;">except the concatenating dimension (i.e., dimension 1).</span>

### Here are a few possible reasons why you might be encountering this error:

1. The input tensor `x` may have a size mismatch before concatenation. Check the size of `x` before the concatenation to make sure it has the expected size.

2. The output tensor `x1` from the decoder path may have a size mismatch. Check the size of `x1` before the concatenation to make sure it has the expected size.

3. The size of the images being fed into the network may not match the expected input size. Check that the input images have the expected size before being passed through the network.

Once you've identified the source of the size mismatch, you can try to adjust the sizes of the tensors or adjust the network architecture to ensure that the tensors have matching sizes along all dimensions except the concatenating dimension.
