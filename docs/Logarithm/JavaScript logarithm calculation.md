### What does this JavaScript do?

```javascript
// Calculate natural logarithm
let log_width = Math.log(width);
let log_height = Math.log(height);
let log_2 = Math.log(2);

if (width > height) {
  // Calculate base-2 logarithm of the width
  return Math.ceil(log_width / log_2);
} else {
  return Math.ceil(log_height / log_2); // Round up to nearest int
}
```

<span style="color:red;">I'm pretty sure the script is wrong, because I think it was actually supposed to return the natural logarithm (base e).  (He said "natural logarithm, base-e".  Unless he "said" base e but "meant" base-2?  He still said "natural", tho.)</span>

This code calculates the base-2 logarithm of the `width` variable rounded up to the nearest integer, if the `width` is greater than `height`.

This can be useful for various purposes such as calculating the number of bits required to represent an image of a certain width.

<span style="color:#0000dd;font-size:larger;">How on earth does Math.log(width) Ã· Math.log(2) give us what we want? ðŸŒŽ ðŸŒ±</span>

The reason why this code calculates the **base-2 logarithm of the `width`** variable rounded up to the nearest integer is to determine the number of bits required to represent an image of a certain width.

In digital image processing, images are often represented as a grid of pixels. Each pixel can be assigned a certain number of bits to represent its color or intensity. The number of bits required to represent a pixel depends on the number of possible values it can take, which is **usually a power of 2.** For example, if a pixel can take 256 different values, then it requires 8 bits to represent it (since 2^8 = 256).

Similarly, the number of bits required to **represent an image of a certain width** depends on the number of pixels in the width dimension.

If the width is a power of 2, then the number of bits required to represent each row of pixels is an **integer power of 2.**

If the width is not a power of 2, then the number of bits required to represent each row of pixels is the **smallest integer power of 2** that is greater than the width.

To calculate this number, we can use the base-2 logarithm of the `width` rounded up to the nearest integer.

This is because the base-2 logarithm of a number tells us **how many times we need to divide it by 2 to get 1**, and rounding up to the nearest integer ensures that we have enough bits to represent the width.

For example, if the width is 1000 pixels, then log2(1000) â‰ˆ 9.97, so we need 10 bits to represent each row of pixels.

```py
numpy.log2(1000)           # 9.965784284662087
numpy.log(1000) / np.log(2)  # 9.965784284662087

numpy.log(1000)            # 6.907755278982137

# See? This is what Math.log(width) is doing.
# Cuz it didn't have a log2(); it does now!
```

The expression `Math.log(width) / Math.log(2)` is used to calculate the base-2 logarithm of the width variable. However, the `Math.log` function in JavaScript calculates the natural logarithm (base e) of a number, not the base-2 logarithm. To convert from the natural logarithm to the base-2 logarithm, we can use the formula `log2(x) = loge(x) / loge(2)`.

This is why the code uses `Math.log(width) / Math.log(2)` to calculate the base-2 logarithm of the width variable.

```js
let width = 1000;
let log_width = Math.log(width);
let log_2 = Math.log(2);

console.log(log_width);        // 6.907755278982137
console.log(log_width / log_2); // 9.965784284662087

// GUESS WHAT!
Math.log2(1000) // 9.965784284662087
```

<span style="color:#0000dd;font-size:larger;">Is "base-2 logarithm" the same as "natural logarithm" the same as Math.log()?</span>

No, the base-2 logarithm and the natural logarithm are different concepts.

`Math.log()` calculates the natural logarithm (base e) of a number, not the base-2 logarithm.

The natural logarithm of a number x is the logarithm to the base e, where e is a mathematical constant approximately equal to 2.71828.

The natural logarithm function `Math.log()` in JavaScript calculates the natural logarithm of a number.

The base-2 logarithm, on the other hand, is the logarithm to the base 2.

It tells us how many times we need to divide a number by 2 to get 1.

For example, the base-2 logarithm of 8 is 3, because `2^3 = 8`.

The base-2 logarithm is commonly used in computer science and digital signal processing.

To convert the natural logarithm to the base-2 logarithm, we can use the formula `log2(x) = loge(x) / loge(2)`.

<span style="color:#000088;font-size:larger;">This formula expresses the fact that the base-2 logarithm of a number x is equal to its natural logarithm divided by the natural logarithm of 2.</span>

In the JavaScript code you provided, the expression `Math.log(width) / Math.log(2)` is used to convert the natural logarithm of the width variable to its base-2 logarithm.
