## Linear Relationships in Data

Let's say we want to see if there's a linear relationship between the **number of hours someone studies** for a test and their **test score.**

The more hours someone studies, the higher their test score tends to be.

x-axis (horizontal) = number of hours

y-axis (vertical) = test score

If the relationship between the two variables is linear, the data points will roughly form a straight line on the graph.

## Non-Linear Relationship

Let's say we're looking at the relationship between the **diameter of a pizza** and its **price.**

*(Actually, you could think of it as linear.  [Predicting Pizza Prices - Linear Regression](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/httlads/PredictiveAnalytics/pizza_regression.html))*

You can see that the points do not form a straight line, and instead form a **curve.**

This means that there is a **non-linear relationship** between the diameter of the pizza and its price.

In this case, the relationship might be that as the diameter of the pizza gets larger, the price **increases at a decreasing rate.**

So a larger pizza might not cost **twice** as much as a smaller pizza, but more like **1.5 times** as much.
