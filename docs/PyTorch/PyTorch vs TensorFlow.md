## PyTorch vs TensorFlow <span style="font-size: 30px;">🔥🔦</span>

What's the idea behind PyTorch?  Wasn't TensorFlow good enough? <span style="font-size: 27px;">🧐</span>

**PyTorch** is a popular open-source machine learning framework that is primarily used for **building** and **training neural networks.** 

The idea behind PyTorch is to provide researchers and developers with a 

* more flexible
* dynamic
* intuitive

tool for working with deep learning models compared to other frameworks like TensorFlow. <span style="font-size: 27px;">🔧</span>

One of the main **differences** between PyTorch and TensorFlow is their approach to **building and training models.** <span style="font-size: 27px;">𝌭</span>

PyTorch uses a **dynamic computational graph**, which means that the graph is created on-the-fly as the model is being built and trained. This makes it **easier to modify** the model during development and to debug the code. <span style="font-size: 30px;">🦸🏻‍♀️</span>

TensorFlow, on the other hand, uses a **static computational graph**, which requires the entire graph to be defined before the model can be trained. <span style="font-size: 30px;">⚡️</span>

**Another advantage** of PyTorch is its ease of use and flexibility. <span style="font-size: 30px;">🧘🏼‍♀️</span>

It has a **user-friendly** interface and a **simple API** that allows users to quickly prototype and experiment with different models. <span style="font-size: 27px;">🐕</span>

PyTorch also provides an **easy** way to **integrate** with other Python libraries, which makes it a popular choice among researchers and developers.

Overall, while TensorFlow is a **powerful and popular** framework, PyTorch provides a **more flexible and intuitive** tool for building and training deep learning models, which makes it a valuable addition to the machine learning toolkit.
