## Create simple Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model

```py
import tensorflow as tf  # Import TensorFlow with alias `tf`
from tensorflow import keras  # Import Keras API from TensorFlow

# Define the model architecture
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
  tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
  tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)  # 10-class classification (mnist)
])
```

This code is using TensorFlow's Keras API to create a simple artificial neural network model. Let's break it down step-by-step:

1. `tf.keras.models.Sequential`: This creates a linear stack of layers that can be thought of as a "sequence". You can create a Sequential model and define all the layers in a list as input to the Sequential model.

2. `tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28))`: The first layer in this network, `tf.keras.layers.Flatten`, transforms the format of the images from a two-dimensional array (of 28 by 28 pixels) to a one-dimensional array (of 28 * 28 = 784 pixels). This layer has no parameters to learn; it only reformats the data. It's often used when input images are fed to a model.

3. `tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu')`: After pixels are flattened, the network consists of a sequence of two `tf.keras.layers.Dense` layers. These are densely connected, or fully connected, neural layers. The first Dense layer has 128 nodes (or neurons). The `relu` activation function is used for this layer, which adds some non-linearity to the model.

4. `tf.keras.layers.Dense(10)`: The last layer returns a logits array with length of 10. Each node contains a score that indicates the current image belongs to one of the 10 classes (assuming you're dealing with a 10-class classification problem). 

In this code, no activation function is defined for the final layer, meaning that it is a linear layer. However, in a multi-class classification problem, **one often applies a softmax** activation function to the output layer to get the probability distribution over the classes.

## Choose a Model

<span style="color:#0000dd;">How do we know which one to use?</span>

The `Sequential` model is one of the most commonly used models in TensorFlow, especially for beginners. The `Sequential` model allows you to create a neural network by simply stacking layers on top of each other, making it easy to define the structure of your model.

You can use the `Sequential` model when your neural network has a linear topology, meaning that the output of one layer is connected to the input of the next layer in a sequential order. This is the most common type of neural network, where data flows through the layers in a **simple sequence**.

However, if your neural network has a **more complex** structure, such as multiple inputs or outputs, or if the layers have more complex connections between them, then you may need to use other types of models, such as the functional API or the subclassing API.

So, to summarize, the `Sequential` model is a good choice when you have a simple neural network with a linear topology. However, as your neural network becomes more complex, you may need to use other types of models to achieve your goals.

## "Flatten" and "Dense"

In machine learning, we often use **neural networks to learn patterns in data**. A neural network is made up of multiple layers of interconnected neurons that transform the input data in a way that allows the network to learn useful representations of the data.

The `Flatten` layer is used to convert multi-dimensional input data, such as images or time series data, into a one-dimensional array. This is necessary because most neural network layers can only work with one-dimensional data. <span style="font-size:27px;">ü•ô</span>

For example, suppose we have an image of size 28x28 pixels, which we want to feed into a neural network. This image can be represented as a 2D array of 28 rows and 28 columns. However, most neural network layers **expect one-dimensional data**, so we need to flatten this 2D array into a one-dimensional array of length 784 (28 x 28). The `Flatten` layer does exactly that &ndash; it takes the multi-dimensional input data and flattens it into a one-dimensional array.

The `Dense` layer is used to **connect** each neuron in one layer to every neuron in the next layer. The `Dense` layer is called dense because every neuron in one layer is connected to every neuron in the next layer. <span style="font-size:27px;">üï∏Ô∏è</span>

The `Dense` layer is where the neural network learns to identify patterns in the input data. Each neuron in a Dense layer receives input from every neuron in the previous layer and computes a **weighted sum** of those inputs. The output of each neuron is then passed through an **activation** function, which determines whether the neuron should fire (output a 1) or not (output a 0). <span style="font-size:27px;">üïπÔ∏è</span>

Let's take the example of a neural network that is used to classify images of handwritten digits. The `Dense` layer in this network takes the flattened image as input and learns to identify patterns in the image that correspond to a particular digit. For example, a `Dense` layer might learn to identify the curved lines and loops that are characteristic of the digit "2". The output of the `Dense` layer is then passed to another `Dense` layer or a final output layer that produces a **prediction** for the digit in the image.
