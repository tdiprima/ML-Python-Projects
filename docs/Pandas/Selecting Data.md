I'm reading a dataset from a csv to pandas dataframe.  This example I have, is doing:

```py
X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values
y = dataset.iloc[:, 4].values
```

Versus:

The **`[::-1]`** syntax is used to **reverse a sequence**, such as a list, tuple, or NumPy array.

In the code snippet `X = dataset.iloc[:, :-1].values`, `iloc` is used to select a subset of the dataframe `dataset`. The `[:, :-1]` notation specifies a range of rows and columns to select. 

The first `:` indicates that we want to select all rows of the dataset. The second `:` indicates that we want to select all columns. The `-1` indicates that we want to select all columns except for the last one. <mark>**So `[:, :-1]` selects all rows of the dataset and all columns except for the last column.**</mark>

The resulting `X` will be a numpy array containing all the rows of `dataset` and all the columns except for the last one.

In the second line `y = dataset.iloc[:, 4].values`, the `iloc` method is again used to select a subset of the dataframe. This time, <mark>**`[:, 4]` selects all rows of the dataset and the 4th column (index starting at 0).**</mark> 

This suggests that the dataset has 5 columns, and **the target variable (the variable to be predicted) is stored in the 5th column (index 4).** The resulting `y` will be a numpy array containing the target variable.

Note that the **`iloc`** method **selects data by position**, not by column name.

If you have **column names**, you can use the **`loc`** method to select data by name, e.g. `dataset.loc[:, 'column_name']`.
