## Explain how to create an Input Function in Tensorflow

Sure! An input function in TensorFlow is a way to tell TensorFlow how to get the data that it needs to train a machine learning model. Here's how you can create an input function:

First, think about the data that you want to use to train your model. For example, if you want to train a model to recognize handwritten numbers, you might have a bunch of images of handwritten numbers.

Next, you need to write some code that reads in that data and prepares it for TensorFlow to use. This code should take the data and convert it into a format that TensorFlow can understand, which is usually an array of numbers.

Once you've written that code, you can define a function that will be your input function. This function should take some parameters that tell it where to find the data you want to use, and how to preprocess that data.

In the body of the input function, you should call the code that you wrote in step 2 to read in and preprocess the data.

Finally, you should return the preprocessed data in a format that TensorFlow can use. This might be a tuple of features and labels, where the features are the input to your model and the labels are the correct outputs.

Here's an example of what an input function might look like in code:

```py
def input_fn(data_path, batch_size):
    # read in data from data_path and preprocess it
    data = read_and_preprocess_data(data_path)

    # create TensorFlow dataset from preprocessed data
    dataset = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices(data)

    # batch the data so that the model trains on small groups of examples at a time
    dataset = dataset.batch(batch_size)

    # define features and labels
    features = dataset[:,:-1]
    labels = dataset[:,-1]

    return features, labels
```

In this example, the `input_fn` function takes two parameters: `data_path` tells it where to find the data, and `batch_size` determines how many examples to train on at a time. The function reads in and preprocesses the data, creates a TensorFlow dataset from it, batches the data, and returns the features and labels that the model will use to train.
