## Full code example Tensorflow Confusion Matrix

Here's a complete TensorFlow code example that:

1. loads data from MNIST
2. creates a model
3. makes predictions
4. calculates the F1-score
5. prints the Confusion matrix

```py
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
from sklearn.metrics import f1_score, confusion_matrix

# Load the MNIST dataset
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()

# Preprocess the data
x_train = x_train / 255.0
x_test = x_test / 255.0

# Define the model architecture
model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Flatten(input_shape=(28, 28)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation='softmax')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam',
              loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
              metrics=['accuracy'])

# Train the model
model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=5)

# Make predictions on the test set
y_pred = model.predict(x_test)
y_pred = np.argmax(y_pred, axis=1)

# Calculate F1 score
f1 = f1_score(y_test, y_pred, average='macro')
print("F1 score:", f1)

# Calculate confusion matrix
cm = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)
print("Confusion matrix:\n", cm)
```

In this code, we first **load the MNIST dataset** using `tf.keras.datasets.mnist.load_data()`. 

We then preprocess the data by **dividing the pixel values** by `255.0` to normalize them.

Next, we **define the model architecture** using `tf.keras.models.Sequential`.

The model consists of a single Flatten layer, a Dense layer with 128 neurons and ReLU activation, and a Dense layer with 10 neurons and softmax activation.

We then compile the model using `model.compile`, specifying the **optimizer** as "adam", the **loss function** as `sparse_categorical_crossentropy`, and the **metrics** as "accuracy".

We **train the model** using `model.fit` with the **training data**.

Next, we use the trained model to **make predictions on the test set** using `model.predict`.

We then **convert** the predicted **probabilities** to **class labels** using `np.argmax`.

We **calculate** the **F1 score** using `f1_score` from `sklearn.metrics`.

We set the **average** parameter to 'macro' to calculate the **macro-average F1 score.**

Finally, we calculate the **confusion matrix** using `confusion_matrix` from `sklearn.metrics` and print both the **F1 score** and the **confusion matrix.**

### What is softmax activation?

Softmax activation converts the output of a neural network to a probability distribution.

### What is the F1-score?
The F1-score is a metric that combines precision and recall to evaluate classification performance.

### How do we know that we have to divide x_train by 255?

The pixel values in the MNIST dataset are gray scale values between 0 and 255. Dividing by 255 scales the values to a range between 0 and 1, which is a common normalization technique for neural networks.

### How do we know that we need to use argmax on y_pred?

The output of the last layer in the neural network is a probability distribution over the classes. Taking the argmax gives the predicted class label.

### How do we know that the output of the last layer in the neural network is a probability distribution over the classes?

The output of the last layer in the neural network is a probability distribution over the classes because the activation function used in the last layer is typically the softmax function, which normalizes the output of the layer to a probability distribution over the classes.


### What would be a "good" F1-score?

A "good" F1-score depends on the specific problem and the relative costs of false positives and false negatives. Generally, higher is better.

### What is ReLU activation?

ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation is an activation function commonly used in neural networks, which outputs the input if it is positive, and 0 otherwise.

### What are activation functions?

Activation functions are like a gatekeeper for each neuron in a neural network. When the neuron receives input, the activation function determines whether or not the neuron should "fire" or activate, based on a specific mathematical rule. This allows the neural network to learn complex patterns and make predictions on new data. Different activation functions have different rules for when a neuron should fire, which can affect the performance of the neural network.

When we define the model architecture, we use 2 activation functions.  How do we know to give it 2?  And how do we know that we should use relu and softmax for this particular problem?
The number of activation functions and the specific activation functions used in the model architecture are hyperparameters that must be tuned through experimentation and evaluation. The choice of activation function depends on the specific problem and the structure of the neural network.

In this particular problem of classifying images of digits, ReLU activation is often used in hidden layers due to its ability to speed up the training process and improve the performance of the neural network. Softmax activation is used in the output layer because it normalizes the output to a probability distribution over the classes, which is suitable for multi-class classification problems like MNIST.

### Hidden layers

So "hidden layers" is just a fancy way of saying that the human doesn't worry about it?  And is the output layer the "answer"?

Hidden layers are so-called because their output is not directly visible to the outside world (i.e., to the user). They are called "hidden" because they are intermediate layers between the input and output layers of the neural network.

The output layer is the final layer of the neural network that produces the predicted output of the model. In the case of classification problems like MNIST, the output layer produces a probability distribution over the classes, which is the predicted probability of each class for a given input. The predicted class label is then obtained by taking the argmax of this distribution. So, in a way, you could say that the output layer produces the "answer" of the neural network.

### Can you teach me this part?

> "the output layer produces a probability distribution over the classes, which is the predicted probability of each class for a given input"

Of course! Let's say you're trying to teach a computer to recognize handwritten numbers. You want the computer to tell you which number is written in each image it sees.

The output layer is the part of the computer's "brain" that gives you the computer's guess for which number it thinks is in the image. But instead of just giving you one guess, the output layer gives you a list of numbers that add up to 1. Each number in the list represents the probability that the image shows a specific number (like the number 3, for example).

So when you ask the computer what number it thinks is in the image, it gives you this list of probabilities. You can then look at the list and see which number has the highest probability. That's the computer's guess for which number is in the image.

When we preprocess the data `x_train = x_train / 255.0`, x_train is an array, and every element of that array is being divided by 255?

Yes, that's correct! The operation x_train = x_train / 255.0 applies division to every element of the array x_train. Since each element in x_train represents a pixel value in an image, dividing each pixel value by 255 scales the pixel values to a range between 0 and 1, which is a common normalization technique for image data in neural networks.


## x, y, huh? what?

It looks like when we use "x" as in "x_train", "x" means "ground truth".  And "y" as in "y_train" means "new data".  Is this correct?

* x = input data, handwritten digits.
* y = output data, corresponding labels.

No, the names x_train and y_train do not have any specific meaning that ties them to "ground truth" or "new data". In machine learning, it is common to use the letter x to refer to the input data (independent variable) and the letter y to refer to the output data (dependent variable or label). In the context of the MNIST dataset, x_train contains the images of handwritten digits, and y_train contains the corresponding labels that indicate which digit each image represents.

It's worth noting that the terms "ground truth" and "new data" are not specific to the names of the input and output variables in machine learning. "Ground truth" typically refers to the true label or value associated with a given data point, while "new data" refers to previously unseen data that the model will make predictions on.

<!--i don't get it.  the dataset gives us `(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test)`.  so is the training data the "answers" and the testing data is... ?-->

## wut?

i understand that x_test would be the images of the digits.  i would think that y_test is something that we then predict.  but the MNST dataset provides it?  I don't understand.

* (x_train, y_train) = train the model (digits and labels)
* (x_test, y_test) = evaluate how well the trained model generalizes to unseen data. (digits and labels)

In the context of supervised learning, the x_train and y_train are used to train the model, while x_test and y_test are used to evaluate how well the trained model generalizes to unseen data.

x_train contains the training samples, which are the input images that the model will learn from. y_train contains the corresponding labels, which are the "answers" or true values that the model will try to predict during training. The model will learn to map the input images to the correct labels by adjusting its parameters through an iterative process called "training".

After the model is trained on x_train and y_train, it is evaluated on x_test and y_test. x_test contains new, unseen images that the model has not encountered during training. y_test contains the corresponding true labels for these images. The model makes predictions on the test images using the parameters it learned during training, and the predictions are compared to the true labels to evaluate the model's performance. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict the true labels for new, unseen images.
