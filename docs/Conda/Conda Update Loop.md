## Conda Update Loop

<span style="color:#0000dd;">When I run `conda update conda`, all it does is tell me to update it.  Which the command should have done.  So I use the command it gave me `conda update -n base -c defaults conda`, and again, it tells me to update conda.</span>

<span style="color:#0000dd;">I imagine I have to just start over.  `which conda` is $HOME/anaconda3/bin/conda.</span>

It seems like you're **experiencing a loop** where conda asks to be updated even after you run the update command.

This is not a common issue, but there are a few possible solutions you can try:

1. **Run the command as an administrator:** Depending on your operating system and settings, it may be that you need to run the conda update command with administrator privileges. Prepend the command with `sudo` (but be aware that using `sudo` with conda is **generally discouraged** because it can cause other issues).

2. **Explicitly specify the version:** Sometimes, there might be issues with the latest version of conda or conflicts with other packages. In such a case, you could try to update conda to a specific version with `conda install conda=version_number`, replacing "version_number" with the desired version (e.g., `conda install conda=4.10.3`).

3. <mark>**Use Miniconda:**</mark> If you're still having issues, you could consider reinstalling Anaconda or switching to Miniconda, which is a smaller distribution that only includes Python and conda, but can still access all the same packages.

4. <mark>**Reset Conda:**</mark> As a last resort, you can completely reset your conda installation by deleting and reinstalling it.

Before doing so, you may want to export your current environment so that you can easily recreate it in the new installation.

```sh
# Export current environment
conda env export > environment.yml
```

Before proceeding with any of these steps, it's a good idea to ensure that you have a **backup** of any important data and that your system is set up to allow you to recover from potential issues.

If you're not comfortable with any of these steps, it would be a good idea to ask for help from someone who is more experienced with these types of system modifications.
