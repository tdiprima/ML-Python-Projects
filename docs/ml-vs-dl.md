## Machine Learning vs. Deep Learning 

<span style="color:#0000dd;">I think you can use ML for literally anything; as long as you can convert it into numbers, and program it to find patterns. Literally it could be anything; any input or output from the universe.</span>

So deep learning is a *subset* of machine learning.  And you're gonna use *deep* neural networks, with **many layers.**  Voil√†.

## ML: Structured data

* Random forest 
* Gradient boosted models 
* Naive Bayes 
* Nearest neighbour 
* Support vector machine 
* ...many more

*Since the advent of deep learning, these are often referred to as "shallow algorithms".*

## DL: Unstructured data

*common algorithms*

* Neural networks
* Fully connected neural network
* Convolutional neural network
* Recurrent neural network
* Transformer
* ...many more
