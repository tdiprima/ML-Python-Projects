### What does `-c` mean?

The flag `-c` is short for `--channel`.

The `-c` flag specifies the package channel from which Conda should install the package. In this case, the package channel is `pytorch`. The PyTorch channel contains the latest versions of PyTorch and related packages.

By specifying `-c pytorch`, Conda will search for the PyTorch package in the PyTorch channel instead of the default channel.
