## Unet

 Imagine you're drawing a picture, but you don't want to color the entire thing. Instead, you want to color just one part of it, like a flower or a tree.

Now, let's say you have a friend who's really good at coloring. You want your friend to color that one part of the picture for you, but you need to tell your friend exactly where to color.

This is kind of like what Unet does in machine learning! Unet is a type of neural network that helps computers "color" specific parts of an image. It's often used in medical imaging to highlight certain parts of an X-ray or MRI scan.

Unet works by taking an image and breaking it down into smaller pieces, sort of like a puzzle. Then, it analyzes each piece to figure out which parts of the image are important and should be highlighted. Finally, it puts all the pieces back together and shows you the final result.

So, just like how you need to tell your friend exactly where to color in your picture, Unet uses a lot of complicated math to figure out which parts of an image are important to highlight. But once it's done, it can help doctors and researchers better understand what's going on inside the human body!
