<span style="color:#000088;font-weight:bold;">Discrete / categorical</span> = things that can be counted or labeled.

A discrete or categorical output variable is a type of variable that can only take on a limited number of values or categories.

This type of output variable is typically associated with **classification** tasks, where the goal is to predict the **category** or **class** to which an input belongs.

A continuous output variable can take on any numeric value within a certain range.

* Predicting the price of a house
* Predicting the temperature outside

```py
# discrete variable (counting apples)
num_apples = 5
print("There are", num_apples, "apples in the basket")

# categorical variable (color of a car)
car_color = "red"
print("The car is", car_color)

# continuous variable (weight of an apple)
apple_weight = 0.153
print("The weight of the apple is", apple_weight, "kg")
```
