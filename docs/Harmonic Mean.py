## In very simple terms, what is the "harmonic mean"?

In very simple terms, the harmonic mean is a type of average that is used to calculate a central or representative value for a set of numbers. It is calculated by dividing the number of values in the set by the sum of the reciprocal of each value in the set.

The reciprocal of a number is simply 1 divided by the number. For example, the reciprocal of 4 is 1/4, and the reciprocal of 5 is 1/5. To calculate the harmonic mean of a set of numbers, we first calculate the reciprocal of each number, then we take the sum of those reciprocals, and finally we divide the number of values in the set by the sum of the reciprocals.

The harmonic mean is often used to calculate averages for rates or ratios, such as the average speed of a journey or the average price-to-earnings ratio of a stock market index. The harmonic mean is generally less affected by extreme values than other types of averages, such as the arithmetic mean or the geometric mean.
