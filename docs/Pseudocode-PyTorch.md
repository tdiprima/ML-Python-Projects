## PyTorch

<!--Can you write me pseudocode for a typical pytorch program?-->

### Sure, here is some pseudocode for a typical PyTorch program:

```py
# Import the necessary libraries
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Define your hyperparameters
learning_rate = 0.01
num_epochs = 10
batch_size = 32

# Load and preprocess your data
train_data, train_labels, test_data, test_labels = load_and_preprocess_data()

# Define your model architecture
model = nn.Sequential(
    nn.Linear(784, 64),
    nn.ReLU(),
    nn.Linear(64, 10)
)

# Define your loss function and optimizer
loss_fn = nn.CrossEntropyLoss()
optimizer = optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=learning_rate)

# Train your model
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for i in range(0, len(train_data), batch_size):
        # Get a batch of data and labels
        data_batch = train_data[i:i+batch_size]
        labels_batch = train_labels[i:i+batch_size]

        # Zero out the gradients
        optimizer.zero_grad()

        # Forward pass
        outputs = model(data_batch)

        # Compute the loss
        loss = loss_fn(outputs, labels_batch)

        # Backward pass and update weights
        loss.backward()
        optimizer.step()

# Evaluate your model on test data
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model(test_data)
    test_loss = loss_fn(outputs, test_labels)
    test_acc = (outputs.argmax(dim=1) == test_labels).float().mean()

# Make predictions with your model
with torch.no_grad():
    predictions = model(test_data)

# Print out some results
print('Test accuracy:', test_acc.item())
print('Predictions:', predictions)
```

In this pseudocode, we first import the necessary libraries, then define some hyperparameters like the learning rate, number of epochs, and batch size. We then load and preprocess our data.

Next, we define our model architecture using PyTorch's `nn.Sequential` API. We then define our loss function and optimizer and set the model's parameters to be optimized.

We then train our model using a loop that goes through each epoch and each batch of data. We first zero out the gradients, perform a forward pass through the model, compute the loss, perform a backward pass, and update the model's weights.

We then evaluate our model on test data using the `with torch.no_grad()` context manager to turn off gradient computation. We also make some predictions with the model.

Finally, we print out some results like the test accuracy and predictions.
