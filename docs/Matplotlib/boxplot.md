## How do you read a boxplot?

A boxplot is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset through its quartiles. Here is how to read a boxplot:

1. **The box:** The box represents the middle 50% of the data, from the first quartile (Q1) to the third quartile (Q3). The line inside the box represents the median of the data.

1. **The whiskers:** The whiskers represent the spread of the data outside of the box. The length of the whiskers is determined by the interquartile range (IQR), which is the difference between the third quartile and the first quartile. By default, the whiskers extend to the most extreme data point that is no more than 1.5 times the IQR away from the box.

In a boxplot, the whiskers are like the arms of the box. They show how far apart the data is spread out from the middle of the box.

Imagine you have a bunch of toys that you want to put away in a toy box. You can fit most of the toys inside the box, but some of them are too big to fit, so you put them on top of the box. The toys inside the box represent the middle 50% of the data, and the toys on top of the box represent the outliers.

Now, imagine that you have really long arms and you're trying to reach for toys that are far away from the box. The distance that you can reach represents the whiskers in the boxplot. The whiskers show how far away the data is spread out from the middle of the box.

So, in summary, the whiskers in a boxplot show how far apart the data is spread out from the middle of the box, kind of like how your long arms can reach for toys that are far away from the box.

1. **Outliers:** Data points that fall outside the whiskers are considered outliers and are plotted as individual points.

1. **The orientation:** Boxplots can be horizontal or vertical. In a vertical boxplot, the y-axis represents the values of the data, and in a horizontal boxplot, the x-axis represents the values of the data.

By looking at a boxplot, you can quickly see the range of the data, the middle 50% of the data, and any outliers. You can also compare the distributions of different datasets by comparing their boxplots.

## Seaborn boxplot coordinates

When I make a seaborn boxplot, it outputs "Text(0.5, 1.0, 'Boxplot')" before drawing the boxplot.  What does the 0.5 and 1.0 mean?

The values 0.5 and 1.0 in the text `Text(0.5, 1.0, 'Boxplot')` refer to the **x and y coordinates of the text label** in the plot.

In this case, the label "Boxplot" is being displayed at coordinates (0.5, 1.0), which means it is

**centered horizontally** (at `x=0.5`) and 

**aligned with the top** of the plot (at `y=1.0`)

Seaborn boxplots often include this default label to help identify the type of plot being shown. You can remove the label by passing the argument `showfliers=False` to the `boxplot()` function, or you can customize the label by passing a string to the `ax.set_title()` method after creating the plot.
