## PyTorch vs TensorFlow

PyTorch is a popular open-source machine learning framework that is primarily used for building and training neural networks.

The idea behind PyTorch is to provide researchers and developers with a 

* More Flexible
* Dynamic
* Intuitive

tool for working with deep learning models compared to other frameworks like TensorFlow.

One of the main differences between PyTorch and TensorFlow is their approach to building and training models. <span style="font-size: 27px;">ùå≠</span>

**PyTorch** uses a dynamic computational graph, which means that the graph is created on-the-fly as the model is being built and trained. This makes it easier to modify the model during development and to debug the code.

**TensorFlow**, on the other hand, uses a static computational graph, which requires the entire graph to be defined before the model can be trained.

Another advantage of PyTorch is its ease of use and flexibility.

It has a user-friendly interface and a simple API that allows users to quickly prototype and experiment with different models.

PyTorch also provides an easy way to integrate with other Python libraries, which makes it a popular choice among researchers and developers.

Overall, while TensorFlow is a powerful and popular framework, PyTorch provides a more flexible and intuitive tool for building and training deep learning models, which makes it a valuable addition to the machine learning toolkit.
