## Discrete, categorical, continuous

<!--Can you teach me the difference between discrete or categorical output variables, versus a continuous output variable?  Please also provide short code examples.-->

Discrete or categorical output variables are **things that can be counted or labeled.**

For example, the number of apples in a basket is discrete, because you can count the exact number of apples. 🍎

Another example is the color of a car, because it can only be labeled as one of a limited number of options. 🚙

On the other hand, a continuous output variable is something that can take on **any value within a certain range.**

For example, the weight of an apple is continuous because it can be any value between a certain minimum and maximum weight. ⚖️ 🏋️

### Discrete variable:

```py
# Example of a discrete variable (counting apples)
num_apples = 5
print("There are", num_apples, "apples in the basket")
```

### Categorical variable:

```py
# Example of a categorical variable (color of a car)
car_color = "red"
print("The car is", car_color)
```

### Continuous variable:

```py
# Example of a continuous variable (weight of an apple)
apple_weight = 0.153
print("The weight of the apple is", apple_weight, "kg")
```
