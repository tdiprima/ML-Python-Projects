## Discrete, categorical, continuous

Discrete or categorical output variables are **things that can be counted or labeled.**

For example, the **number of apples** in a basket is discrete, because you can **count** the exact number of apples. <span style="font-size: 27px;">🍎</span>

Another example is the **color of a car**, because it can only be **labeled as one** of a limited number of options. <span style="font-size: 27px;">🚙</span>

On the other hand, a continuous output variable is something that can take on **any value within a certain range.**

For example, the **weight** of an apple is continuous because it can be any value between a certain minimum and maximum weight. <span style="font-size: 27px;">⚖️ 🏋️</span>

### Discrete (number):

```py
# Example of a discrete variable (counting apples)
num_apples = 5
print("There are", num_apples, "apples in the basket")
```

### Categorical (label):

```py
# Example of a categorical variable (color of a car)
car_color = "red"
print("The car is", car_color)
```

### Continuous (number):

```py
# Example of a continuous variable (weight of an apple)
apple_weight = 0.153
print("The weight of the apple is", apple_weight, "kg")
```
