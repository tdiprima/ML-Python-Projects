## learning rate and loss function

In machine learning, we use a **"loss function"** to measure how well our model is doing at making predictions. The loss function takes in the predicted output of the model and the true output (i.e. the "ground truth") and returns a number that represents how well the model is doing.

The goal of the learning process is to **minimize the loss function**, which means we want to make the model's predictions as close as possible to the true outputs. To do this, we use an optimization algorithm called "gradient descent" to update the model's parameters (i.e. the weights and biases of the neurons) in the direction that reduces the loss.

The "learning rate" is a parameter that determines how much the model's parameters are updated during each iteration of the learning process. A higher learning rate means that the model's parameters will be updated more aggressively, which can help the model converge to a good solution faster. However, if the learning rate is too high, the model may overshoot the optimal solution and diverge.

A lower learning rate means that the model's parameters will be updated more slowly, which can help the model avoid overshooting the optimal solution. However, if the learning rate is too low, the model may take a long time to converge to a good solution, or it may get stuck in a suboptimal solution.

Choosing a good learning rate is an important part of training a machine learning model. In practice, you usually start with a reasonable learning rate (such as 0.01) and experiment with adjusting it to see how it affects the performance of the model.

## "loss function" = "glass half empty"

So the "loss function" really measures how bad the model is doing?  It seems like it's a glass half empty kind of name for that function.

Yes, you're exactly right! The loss function measures how "bad" the model is doing by comparing its predictions to the true outputs.

ðŸ’¡The lower the value of the loss function, the "better" the model is doing.

It's actually a very important and useful concept in machine learning. Without the loss function, we wouldn't have a way to **measure the performance** of the model, and we wouldn't know how to **update its parameters** to make it better.

## Learning rate values

OK, so we start with a reasonable learning rate (such as 0.01).  Is there an upper limit to the range of values to try?  Like, what numbers do people usually pick on the 2nd or 3rd iteration?

The upper limit of the learning rate depends on the specific problem and the model architecture you are using. If the learning rate is too high, the model may overshoot the optimal solution and diverge, which means that the loss function will increase instead of decrease over time. In extreme cases, the loss can even become NaN (not a number) because of numeric instability.

There's no fixed range of learning rates to try in the 2nd or 3rd iteration, as it depends on the specifics of the problem and the model. A common practice is to try learning rates that are one or two orders of magnitude smaller and larger than the initial learning rate, and then see which learning rate works best. For example, if the initial learning rate is 0.01, you could try 0.001, 0.0001, 0.1, 1, etc.

However, it's important to keep in mind that changing the learning rate is just one of many hyperparameters that can affect the performance of a model. Other hyperparameters such as the number of layers, the number of neurons in each layer, the batch size, and the activation functions can also have a big impact on the performance of the model, so it's important to experiment with different values for all of these hyperparameters to find the best combination.
