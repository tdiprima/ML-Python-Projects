## Teaching Neural Networks: Backpropagation

<!--Sure, I'd be happy to explain backpropagation in a way that a 10-year-old can understand!-->

Let's start by thinking about how we can teach a computer to recognize objects in pictures. One way to do this is by using a neural network, which is like a big mathematical function that can learn to identify patterns in pictures.

To train a neural network, we need to give it lots of examples of pictures and tell it what object is in each picture. The network looks at the picture and makes a guess about what object it might be, and then we tell it whether it was right or wrong. If it was wrong, we need to adjust the network's parameters (which are like the knobs on a stereo) so that it does better next time.

Backpropagation is the algorithm that we use to adjust the network's parameters based on whether it was right or wrong. Here's how it works:

We give the neural network a picture and it makes a guess about what object is in the picture.
We compare the network's guess to the correct answer and calculate how far off it was. This is like measuring the distance between where the network was and where it should have been.
We use the distance to figure out how much each parameter in the network needs to change to make the network do better next time. This is like turning the knobs on a stereo to make the music sound better.
We update the parameters and give the network another picture to guess on.
We repeat this process for lots and lots of pictures, and over time the network gets better and better at recognizing objects in pictures. It's like a student who practices doing math problems until they get better at it.

So that's how backpropagation works! It's a way of teaching a neural network to get better at recognizing patterns in pictures by adjusting its parameters based on whether it was right or wrong.

## Tensorflow

Does python tensorflow do this for us?  If not, can you show me a code example?
Yes, TensorFlow, which is a popular deep learning library in Python, includes automatic differentiation and optimization algorithms that can perform backpropagation for you. So you don't have to implement the backpropagation algorithm yourself.

Here's an example of how you can use TensorFlow to create a simple neural network and train it on a dataset using the backpropagation algorithm:

```py
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

# Define the neural network architecture
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(16, activation='relu', input_shape=(4,)),
    tf.keras.layers.Dense(3, activation='softmax')
])

# Define the loss function and optimization algorithm
loss_fn = tf.keras.losses.CategoricalCrossentropy()
optimizer = tf.keras.optimizers.SGD(learning_rate=0.1)

# Load a dataset
iris = tf.keras.datasets.iris
(x_train, y_train), (x_test, y_test) = iris.load_data()

# Preprocess the data
x_train = x_train.astype(np.float32)
x_test = x_test.astype(np.float32)
y_train = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_train, num_classes=3)
y_test = tf.keras.utils.to_categorical(y_test, num_classes=3)

# Train the model
batch_size = 32
epochs = 100
for epoch in range(epochs):
    for batch in range(len(x_train)//batch_size):
        start = batch * batch_size
        end = start + batch_size
        x_batch = x_train[start:end]
        y_batch = y_train[start:end]
        
        with tf.GradientTape() as tape:
            y_pred = model(x_batch)
            loss = loss_fn(y_batch, y_pred)
        gradients = tape.gradient(loss, model.trainable_variables)
        optimizer.apply_gradients(zip(gradients, model.trainable_variables))

    # Evaluate the model on the test set
    y_pred = model(x_test)
    test_loss = loss_fn(y_test, y_pred)
    test_accuracy = tf.keras.metrics.CategoricalAccuracy()(y_test, y_pred)
    print(f'Epoch {epoch+1}, loss={loss:.2f}, test_loss={test_loss:.2f}, test_accuracy={test_accuracy:.2f}')
```

This code defines a neural network with one hidden layer and an output layer, loads the Iris dataset, preprocesses the data, and trains the model using the backpropagation algorithm. The training loop updates the model parameters using the gradients computed by tf.GradientTape, which automatically differentiates the loss function with respect to the model parameters. The optimizer applies the computed gradients to the model parameters to update them.

The model is trained for 100 epochs, and for each epoch, the code evaluates the model on the test set and prints the training loss, test loss, and test accuracy. This is a simple example, but you can use similar code to train more complex neural networks on more challenging datasets.
