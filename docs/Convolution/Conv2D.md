## Conv2D Layer Detects Image Features

Imagine you have a bunch of photos of dogs and cats, and you want a computer program to figure out which is which. These photos are just a bunch of colored dots, called pixels, arranged in a grid. A Conv2D layer in a deep learning model is like a tiny detective that scans through each photo to find important clues, like edges, corners, or textures, that can help the model tell dogs apart from cats.

The Conv2D layer does this by using something called a "filter," which is like a mini-picture frame that moves over the image. At each spot, it does some math to transform the pixels inside its frame into a single value. This process creates a new grid of numbers, or a "feature map," that highlights the important clues in the original image. The model uses these feature maps to make better decisions about what's in the photo.

So, in summary, a Conv2D layer scans an image to find important features like edges and textures, helping the computer figure out what's in the image.
