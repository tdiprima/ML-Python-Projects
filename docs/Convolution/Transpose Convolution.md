## What is it? What does it do?

A **transpose convolution layer** is a special type of layer used in a type of artificial intelligence called deep learning. Its job is to take an input image or data and **make it bigger.**

You can think of it like a machine that takes a small picture and turns it into a big one. The way it does this is by using a set of special filters that stretch the picture out in different directions.

So you take an image and put it under a microscope, sort of.  If you put it under the transpose convolution layer, it will be like someone took the flower and blew it up to be much bigger on the page. 

This is really useful in deep learning because sometimes we want to work with images or data that are bigger than the ones we have. The transpose convolution layer helps us do that by making the images or data bigger **so we can work with them more easily.**
