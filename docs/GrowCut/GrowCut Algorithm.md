## Grow Cut Algorithm explained

The Grow Cut algorithm is a technique used in machine learning for image segmentation, which means separating different parts of an image into individual segments. The idea behind the Grow Cut algorithm is to start with a seed point, which is a pixel that belongs to a particular segment, and grow the segment by gradually adding pixels to it.

e.g. It grows the colored part and cuts off the parts that are different.

Here's a simple example in Python:

```python
import numpy as np
from skimage import io, segmentation, color

# Load an image
img = io.imread('example_image.png')

# Convert the image to grayscale
gray_img = color.rgb2gray(img)

# Set a seed point in the middle of the image
seed = (gray_img.shape[0] // 2, gray_img.shape[1] // 2)

# Use the grow cut algorithm to segment the image
labels = segmentation.grow_cut(gray_img, [seed])

# Display the segmented image
io.imshow(color.label2rgb(labels, img))
io.show()
```

In this example, we first load an image and convert it to grayscale. We then set a seed point in the middle of the image. Finally, we use the `grow_cut` function from the `skimage` library to segment the image based on the seed point. The resulting labels are then displayed using the `imshow` function from `skimage.io`.

### Segmentation

Image segmentation is like cutting out a picture from a magazine, so you can use it for a project. The Grow cut algorithm is a special tool that helps computers do this cutting out automatically.

So that's how you can remember right away that "grow cut" does segmentation.

GrowCut is an interactive segmentation algorithm.

"Background and Foreground"

Each cell of the automata has some <mark>**label (in case of binary segmentation - 'object', 'background' and 'empty').**</mark>
