## Stable diffusion explained

<!--Sure, I'd be happy to explain stable diffusion in a way that's easy to understand!-->

Imagine that you have a glass of water with some food coloring in it. If you take a toothpick and stir the water, you'll see that the color starts to spread out and mix with the rest of the water. This is called diffusion.

Now, stable diffusion is when the food coloring spreads out evenly throughout the water and stays that way. This means that if you leave the glass of water alone for a while, the food coloring won't separate or clump together in one spot. Instead, it will stay evenly distributed throughout the water.

Stable diffusion happens when the particles that are being diffused are the same size and weight, and when the temperature and pressure of the environment are consistent. It's like when you mix two colors of paint together really well and end up with a new color that stays the same no matter how long you leave it alone.

I hope that helps you understand stable diffusion!
