## How to go about solving a machine learning problem

Machine learning is a powerful tool used in many fields, including computer vision, natural language processing, and even finance.

### Step 1: Define the Problem 📝

What am I trying to do?  Have a clear understanding of the problem.

If you're working on a project that predicts house prices, your goal might be to **create a model that accurately predicts the price of a house** based on various *_features_* such as **location, size, and number of bedrooms**.

### Step 2: Collect Data 📀

Finding a dataset that has **examples** of what you want the machine learning model to learn.

You might use a dataset of **house prices** and their **corresponding features**.

### Step 3: Prepare the Data 👩‍🍳

You need to **prepare** it (clean it up) for the machine learning model.

* Removing any missing values
* Converting categorical variables to numerical ones
* Scaling the data so that all features have a similar range

### Step 4: Choose a Model <span style="font-size:30px;">⨐</span>

Choose one that's appropriate for the problem you're trying to solve.

Some popular models include:

* Linear regression
* Decision trees
* Neural networks

<span style="color:#0000dd;">It's like a function that takes in inputs (data) and produces outputs (predictions or classifications). Models are trained using data, which means that they are "taught" how to make predictions or classifications based on patterns in the data.</span>

<span style="color:#0000dd;">The model is using data to learn how to solve a problem or make predictions. The quality of the model's performance depends on how well it has learned from the examples provided to it.</span>

### Step 5: Train the Model 🏋️

Train the model on the data.

**Feeding** the data into the model and **adjusting** its **parameters** to **minimize the error** between the model's **predictions** and the **actual** values in the dataset.

### Step 6: Evaluate the Model 👩‍⚖️

Evaluate its performance on **new data**.

Test the model on a portion of the dataset that it hasn't seen before, and measure how well it performs.

### Step 7: Tune the Model 📻

If the model isn't accurate enough, you can try **adjusting its parameters** or **trying different models** until you find one that works well.

### Step 8: Deploy the Model 🚀 

Deploy it in a production environment.

**Using the model to make predictions** on new data in the real world.
