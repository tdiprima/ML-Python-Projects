## PythonML is Fun

This repo contains the Python code for a number of machine learniing algorithms such as Decision Trees and SVM.

There is also code for artifical neural networks (ANN) and Deep Learning applications such as CNN. The deep learning applications have been demonstrated using the Keras library.
