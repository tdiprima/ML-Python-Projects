# Here is an example machine learning code in Python, using scikit-learn, to
# train a model to classify iris flowers based on their sepal length and width:
import pandas as pd
from sklearn import metrics
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier

# Load the iris dataset
df = pd.read_csv("iris.csv")

# Split the data into features (X) and labels (y)
X = df[["sepal_length", "sepal_width"]]
y = df["species"]

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=0)

# Train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier
knn = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
knn.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Use the trained classifier to predict the species of iris flowers in the test set
y_pred = knn.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the accuracy of the classifier
print("Accuracy:", metrics.accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred))

"""
In this code, we first load the iris dataset using pandas, and then split the data into features (the sepal length and
width) and labels (the species of the iris flower). The data is then split into training and testing sets using the
train_test_split function from scikit-learn.

Next, we train a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier using the fit method on the training data. The
KNeighborsClassifier class is imported from scikit-learn.

Finally, we use the trained classifier to make predictions on the test data and evaluate the accuracy of the classifier
using the accuracy_score function from the metrics module of scikit-learn.
