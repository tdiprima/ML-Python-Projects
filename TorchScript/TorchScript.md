## PyTorch JavaScript Implementation

Yes, PyTorch has a JavaScript implementation called TorchScript. TorchScript allows PyTorch models to be compiled into a portable format that can be executed in different environments, including JavaScript.

Here's an example of how you can use a PyTorch model in JavaScript with TorchScript:

## Python

First, let's create a simple PyTorch model in Python:

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(2, 4)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(4, 1)
        
    def forward(self, x):
        x = nn.functional.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

model = Net()
```

Next, let's export the model to TorchScript:

```python
import torch.jit

traced_script_module = torch.jit.trace(model, torch.randn(1, 2))
traced_script_module.save("model.pt")
```

This will create a file named `model.pt` that contains the serialized TorchScript representation of the model.

## JavaScript

Now let's use the exported model in JavaScript. First, we need to load the `model.pt` file into a `ScriptModule` object:

```javascript
const {ScriptModule} = require('@pytorch/torchscript');
const fs = require('fs');

const buffer = fs.readFileSync('model.pt');
const model = new ScriptModule(buffer);
```

Finally, we can use the model to make predictions in JavaScript:


```javascript
const input = new Float32Array([1.0, 2.0]);
const output = model.forward([input]).toTensor();
console.log(output.data);
```

This will output the result of the forward pass of the model given the input `[1.0, 2.0]` in JavaScript.


## npm

To use `@pytorch/torchscript` in a Node.js JavaScript code, you will need to install the package using npm. You can do this by running the following command in your project directory:

```ruby
npm install @pytorch/torchscript
```

Once you have installed the package, you can import it into your JavaScript code using the require statement:

```js
const torchscript = require('@pytorch/torchscript');
```

You can then use the torchscript object to load your PyTorchTorchScript model, like this:

```js
const fs = require('fs');
const modelBytes = fs.readFileSync('model.pt');
const model = torchscript.load(modelBytes);
```

In this example, model.pt is the file that contains your TorchScript model, and modelBytes is a buffer containing the contents of that file. The torchscript.load function returns a ScriptModule object, which you can use to run your model.

Note that in order to use `@pytorch/torchscript`, you will need to have Node.js version 12 or later installed on your system.

### And of course, it doesn't work.

There is no such thing as `@pytorch/torchscript`.

Try that:

https://www.npmjs.com/package/pytorchjs

and that:

<!--https://www.npmjs.com/package/pytorch-zero-to-all-->

```ruby
npm i -D pytorchjs
```

```js
import { torch, torchvision } from 'pytorchjs';
```
